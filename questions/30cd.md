## 30cd: *Heap exhaustion*

***Disclaimer:*** *in this question we will use Java's exception
throwing mechanism to probe the size of the runtime heap.  As in [question 7e2a](7e2a.md), this is simply so that you can get some feeling for how the Java
runtime works, and to show you more examples of how exceptions work.  Again, it would be very bad practice to write a real
application that deliberately uses up all available heap memory!*

At runtime, the Java Virtual Machine reserves a certain amount of memory for the program *heap*, where *objects* live.
Each time a new object is created, some memory is allocated on the heap.  When an object becomes unreachable, the JVM's *garbage
collector* will, in due course, free the associated memory.

If you create a very large number of objects, and if these objects remain reachable, you can exhaust the heap memory.  In this case the
JVM will throw an `OutOfMemoryError`.  `OutOfMemoryError` is another subclass of the abstract `VirtualMachineError` class.

Write a program that uses an infinite loop to create `Integer` objects in such a way that they are never garbage-collected.
Intercept the `OutOfMemoryError` that will eventually be thrown, and print the number of `Integer` objects that were
created before heap memory was exhausted.
