## a6e7: *Int set iterators*


If you succeeded at the bulk of [question 85bb](85bb.md)
then should do something similar for your `IntSet` interface and implementing classes
of [question 8a61](8a61.md).  This will allow us to explore some very cool features of abstract classes.

### Step 1
Create a `IntSetIterator` interface, with the following methods:

```
public boolean hasNext();

public int next();
```

### Step 2
Create an iterator class corresponding to each of `MemoryEfficientIntSet` and `SpeedEfficientIntSet`, and implement
the `iterator` method in `MemoryEfficient``IntSet` and `SpeedEfficientIntSet`.  If you implemented
the integer set classes by simply wrapping the `Set<Integer>` class, then your iterator classes should simply be wrappers for the
`Iterator<Integer>` object that can be obtained from a `Set<Integer>` by invoking its `iterator()` method.

### Step 3
Create an abstract class `AbstractIntSet` which implements `IntSet`, and change `MemoryEfficientIntSet`
and `SpeedEfficientIntSet` to extend this abstract class.  Use your iterator interface to implement a suitable `toString` method in
`AbstractIntSet`.

### Step 4
Add the following additional methods to the `IntSet` interface:

```
// Add to the set each element in 'other'
public void addAll(IntSet other);

// Remove from the set each element in 'other'
public void removeAll(IntSet other);

// Return true iff the set contains every element of 'other'
public boolean contains(IntSet other);
```

### Step 5
Implement each of these methods in `AbstractIntSet`.  You should be able to implement the
methods using `IntSetIterator`, with *no reference* to the specific type of sets
(memory or speed efficient) that are being used.  Very cool, huh?

Once again, this illustrates the immense power of abstract classes and interfaces.
