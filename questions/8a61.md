## 8a61: *Int set*

It is worth trying [question 1486](1486.md) first, though this is only a weak dependency.

### Step 1

Write an interface, `IntSet`, to represent a set of integers.
Your interface should support the following methods:

```
// Adds the integer x to the set
public void add(int x);

// If the integer x belongs to the set, it is removed and 'true'
// is returned.  Otherwise 'false' is returned
public boolean remove(int x);

// Returns true iff the set is empty
public boolean isEmpty();

// Returns true iff the set contains the integer x
public boolean contains(int x);
```

### Step 2

Now provide two classes that *implement* `IntSet`: `MemoryEfficientIntSet`
and `SpeedEfficientIntSet`.  The idea is that `MemoryEfficientIntSet` would
be suitable for representing large sets, using minimal memory but at the expense of slower
element lookup operations, while `SpeedEfficientSet` would be optimised for fast
element lookup, at the expense of requiring more memory.

However, in this question you do not need to implement these classes to *actually*
be memory/space efficient -- the distinction between these sets is for purposes of illustration
only.  Implement the two classes in any way which conforms to the
`IntSet` interface: if you wish you can use the same implementation for both,
and it is fine to realise these sets by delegating to classes in the Java Collections
framework.

**Hint:**  A simple solution is for `MemoryEfficientIntSet` to
have a member of type `Set<Integer>`.  You can then implement `add()`,
`remove()`, `isEmpty()` and `contains()` in a very straightforward
manner by *delegating* these calls to the `Set<Integer>` member.  You can implement
`SpeedEfficientIntSet` similarly.  This may seem pointless: why not just use a `Set<Integer>`
directly?  Of course, it *is* pointless.  However, going through this process provides a solid
educational example of how classes and interfaces work.

### Step 3

Write a `Demo` class with a static method:

```
public static IntSet readIntegers(int n) throws IOException;
```

The `readIntegers` method should read *n* integers from standard input.  If *n > 10* the
method should return a memory efficient set containing these integers, otherwise it should return
a space efficient set.  (You can assume that the integers entered are all distinct.)

### Step 4

Write a `main` method which gets an `IntSet` by calling `readIntegers`,
where the parameter *n* is given by a command-line argument.  On returning from `readIntegers`,
`main` should indicate which type of set has been returned.  After this, `main`
should repeatedly ask the user to enter an integer, in each case indicating whether the integer
belongs to the set.  When the user enters the "end of input" character, the program should terminate.

Assuming that `3` is given as a command-line argument, an interactive session with your
program might look like the following:

```
Please enter an int:
10
Please enter an int:
20
Please enter an int:
30
Set is: class tutorialquestions.question8a61.SpeedEfficientIntSet
Enter an int, to be tested for membership:
10
Set contains 10: true
Enter an int, to be tested for membership:
11
Set contains 11: false
Enter an int, to be tested for membership:
12
Set contains 12: false
Enter an int, to be tested for membership:
20
Set contains 20: true
Enter an int, to be tested for membership:
^D
Goodbye!
```
