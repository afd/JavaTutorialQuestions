## 710c: *The consequences of overriding `equals`*

If all you did in [question 5235](5235.md) was override `equals` then you can run into some interesting problems.
The `Object` class provides another method, `hashCode`, which returns an integer derived from the object on which the method is invoked.
Java requires that `hashCode` should return the same hash code for any two objects `o1` and `o2` such that
`o1.equals(o2)` holds.  It is the programmer's responsibility to enforce this: if you override `equals` then
you must also override `hashCode` such that `o1.equals(o2)` => `o1.hashCode()` `== o2.hashCode()`.

Let us try creating a `Set` of `Point`s.  We write:

```
Set<Point> pointSet = new HashSet<Point>();
```

to make such a set.  This gives us an object conforming to the `Set<Point>` interface (the object's
*apparent* type); the created object is actually a `HashSet` (the object's *actual* type).
A hash set permits efficient lookup by using an object's hash code to assign it to one of a number of *buckets*.
Determining whether an object belongs to the set involves finding the bucket corresponding to the object, and then
looking through the bucket.  For the above to work, you must import `java.util.HashSet` and `java.util.Set`.

Demonstrate the problems that can ensue from this scenario by writing a Java program that creates two identical points `p`
and `q`, and adds `p` to `pointSet`.  Get your program to print a message confirming whether `p.equals(q)`
holds (it should), and whether `pointSet.contains(q)` holds.  The latter should *intuitively* be true, but if you have not overridden
`hashCode`, it will not.

Now override `hashCode` in a manner that ensures that two equal points get the same hash code.  A high quality hash function should also try
to make sure that non-equal points get different hash codes whenever possible.  Writing a high quality hash code is challenging and interesting -- feel
free to experiment with this (there are a lot of good tutorials online on this topic) but any technically correct hash coding scheme is fine for this
exercise.  By *technically correct*, I mean an implementation of `hashCode` that satisfies:

```
o1.equals(o2) => o1.hashCode() == o2.hashCode()
```

However you decide to implement `hashCode`, confirm that it solves the problem you identified above: `pointSet.contains(q)` should
become *true*.

Now consider the `ColouredPoint` class.  Is it necessary to override `hashCode` in this class, given that
you have overridden `equals`?  If not, is there any benefit to doing so?
