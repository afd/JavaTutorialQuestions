## b4a5: *Observing the garbage collector*

Class `Object` provides a method:

```
public void finalize();
```

which is called when an object is garbage-collected.

This method was deprecated in Java 9.  (See [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/56454348) for some interesting insights into why it was deprecated.)  As a result, you should not use `finalize` in your code.

Neverthelss, experimenting with `finalize` can provide interesting insights into how garbage collection works, and in this question, we will use `finalize` to observe the behaviour of the garbage collector.

**Disclaimer:** This exercise is purely educational, to let you see the garbage collector in action,
and to get more experience writing simple Java programs.  You should likely never write a real program that uses `finalize`, since it is deprecated, and you should *never* write a real program that abuses `finalize` in this way!

Write a class, `A`, with a private `int` field called `id`.  `A` should have a single constructor, which
should take an integer parameter used to initialise `id`.

In addition, `A` should have a package-visible static field, `numCollected`, initialised to zero.

Override `finalize` in `A`.  Your implementation of `finalize` should print a message, saying that the instance of `A`
with id `id` has been garbage collected.  After printing this message, the static field `numCollected` should be incremented.

Finally, write a `main` method that creates a million instances of `A`, with increasing ids, in a loop, but does not assign any of these instances to a reference variable.  (To create but not assign a new instance of `A`, you simply write a statement: `new A(...);`)

Run your program several times and inspect the output it produces.

What does this tell you about the garbage collector?  What guarantees are provided on how `finalize` will be invoked?
