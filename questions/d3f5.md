## d3f5: *Streams and downcasting*

In an `Example` class, write a method `restrictToPositiveIntegers` with the following signature:

      static Stream<Integer> restrictToPositiveIntegers(Stream<Number> numbers);
      
Given a stream of `Number`s, the method should return the substream of this stream comprised of only those numbers of type `Integer` whose integer value is positive.

The body of `restrictToPositiveIntegers` should be a single statement, and it should *not* convert the input stream to a list or any other collection.

Write a `main` method showing that if you create a `List<Number>` called `numbers` populated with various `Integer`, `Float`, `Double` and `Short` values, and then do:

        System.out.println("Positive integers from " + numbers + " are: "
            + restrictToPositiveIntegers(numbers.stream()).collect(Collectors.toList()));

you see precisely the positive integers from your list of numbers being output.

Try creating a `List<Float>` or `List<Integer>` and invoking `restrictToPositiveIntegers` on a stream derived from each of these lists.  You should find that this does not compile.

**Advanced:** Write a method, `restrictToPositiveIntegersBoundedWildcard`, that can take a stream of any type `T` that is `Number` or one of `Number`'s subclasses and return the substream containing only those positive integers from the original stream.

**Hints**

* You will need to use instance testing and downcasting in the implementation of `restrictToPositiveIntegers`.
* For `restrictToPositiveIntegersBoundedWildcard`, the clue is in the name!
