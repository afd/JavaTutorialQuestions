## 845d: *Books and dictionaries*

Consider the following class, which represents a book:

[Book.java](../solutions/code/tutorialquestions/question845d/Book.java)

Write a class `Dictionary` as a subclass of `Book`. `Dictionary`
should provide a constructor:

```
public Dictionary(String isbn,
                  String title,
                  int pages,
                  String sourceLanguage,
                  String targetLanguage,
                  int numDefinitions);
```

that constructs the dictionary, recording which language it can translate to and from
(e.g.~a Spanish-English dictionary), and the number of definitions the dictionary
contains.  `Dictionary` should also override `toString()` to
provide a string representation of all the object's details.

Now write a class `Bookshelf` that can store books.  Books should
be stored in an object with apparent type `java.util.List` and
actual type `java.util.LinkedList`.  `Bookshelf` should
provide the following methods:

```
// Returns the number of books on the bookshelf
public int size();

// Adds a book on the left side of the shelf.
// Shifts all other books one position to the right
public void addBookOnLeftSide(Book b);

// Adds a book on the right side of the shelf.
public void addBookOnRightSide(Book b);

// Adds book in position i counting from the left, starting
// from zero, and shifts all other books one position to the right.
// Hence addBook(0, b) is equivalent to addBookOnLeftSide(b), and
// addBook(size(), b) is equivalent to addBookOnRightSide(b)
public void addBook(int i, Book b);

// Removes book from position i, shifting all books with position
// greater than i to the left
public Book remove(int i);

// Prints all details of books from left to right
public void printLeftToRight();

// Prints all details of books from right to left
public void printRightToLeft();
```

Write a program that constructs a bookshelf containing six books: two dictionaries
and four non-dictionaries, inserted in any order you wish, and prints the resulting
bookshelf from left-to-right, and then from right-to-left.

Finally, write a static method that takes a bookshelf parameter and rearranges the books
so that all the dictionaries are on the right.  This method should operate using
only the `Bookshelf` interface given above: you should not need to add any
further methods to `Bookshelf`, or directly access any fields of a `Bookshelf`.
Extend your demo program to show this
method in action.
