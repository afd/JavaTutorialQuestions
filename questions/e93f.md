## e93f: *Apparent and actual types*


Consider the following classes:

\begin{lstlisting}
public class A {

}

public class B extends A {

}

public class C {

    public void accept(A a) {

        System.out.println("Accepted object of type A.");

    }
}

public class D extends C {

    public void accept(B b) {

        System.out.println("Accepted object of type B.");

    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

Does the `accept` method in `D` override the `accept` method in `C`?  Explain your answer.

What will the following code print?

\begin{lstlisting}
public class Test {

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		B b = new B();
		
		C c = new D();
		c.accept(b);
		
		D d = new D();
		d.accept(b);
		
	}

}
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Note:} The point of this question is that you should try to figure this out
*without* simply typing in the program and running it!  (Though you can of course
do this to check your answer.)
