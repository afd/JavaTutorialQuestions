## e93f: *Apparent and actual types*

Consider the following classes:

```
public class A {

}

public class B extends A {

}

public class C {

  public void accept(A a) {
    System.out.println("Accepted object of type A.");
  }

}

public class D extends C {

  public void accept(B b) {
    System.out.println("Accepted object of type B.");
  }

}
```

Does the `accept` method in `D` override the `accept` method in `C`?  Explain your answer.

What will the following code print?

```
public class Test {

  public static void main(String[] args) {

    B b = new B();

    C c = new D();
    c.accept(b);

    D d = new D();
    d.accept(b);

  }

}
```

**Note:** The point of this question is that you should try to figure this out
*without* simply typing in the program and running it!  (Though you can of course
do this to check your answer.)
