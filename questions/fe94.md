## fe94: *Using Stream.map and Stream.filter*

This question is about writing static methods that use the `map` and `filter` operations on streams.

1. Create a class, `Example`, that we will use as a placeholder for the static methods that you will write.

2. Write a static method with the following signature: 

    static List<String> reverseEachString(List<String> input);

   This method should return a list whose contents are identical to the strings in `input`, except that each string should be reversed.  For example, if you invoked `reverseEachString` on the list `[ "hello", "world" ]`, you should get back the list `[ "olleh", "dlrow" ]`.

   Your implementation should comprise a *single* statement that should get a stream from the list, apply multiple map operations to the stream, and collect the result back into a list.

   In particular, you should map the constructor of `StringBuilder` over the stream, to get a stream of `StringBuilder`s, then map the `reverse` method of `StringBuilder` over this stream, then map the `toString` method of `StringBuilder` over the resulting stream to get a stream of `String`s again.

 3. Now write an alternative version of `reverseEachString`, called `reverseEachStringMonolithic`.  This should behave in a functionally identical manner to `reverseEachString`, but instead of applying multiple map operations, a *single* map operation should be used that combines the effects of all of the map operations you used in `reverseEachString`.

4. Write a static method with the following signature:

    static List<Double> sqrtsOfFirstDigits(List<String> input);

   This method should turns `input` into a stream, filter to just those strings that start with a digit, map each remaining string to the integer corresponding to its first digit, and then map each such integer to its square root via the `Math.sqrt` function, returning the resulting stream collected as a list.

5. Now write an alternative version of `sqrtsOfFirstDigits`, called `sqrtsOfFirstDigitsMonolithic`.  This should have the same behaviour as `sqrtsOfFirstDigits`, but should use just one call to `map` and one call to `filter` (as well as the usual calls to `stream` and `collect`).

6. Write a `main` method to demonstrate that your static methods work on some example inputs.
