## 290b: *Memory leaks in Java*

A problem with the object pool optimisation is that it can cause a *memory leak*.  Once a `Point` is created and added to `pool` it can *never* be released, even if there are no references to the point in the rest of the application.  The fact that `pool` references the point means that the point cannot be garbage-collected.

This problem has the potential to cause exhaustion of heap memory.  Demonstrate this by writing a simple program that uses `makePoint` to create, but not keep track of, a vast number of distinct `Point` objects.  If you create a large enough number of points, you should find that your program quits with an "out of memory" error.

You can solve this issue through the use of Java's `WeakReference` and `WeakHashMap` classes.

Read about these classes in the Java documentation:

* https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/lang/ref/WeakReference.html

* https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/WeakHashMap.html

Use these classes to change your implementation of `Point` pooling so that a memory leak cannot occur.  Write a program to demonstrate that this is working: your program should create, but not keep track of a large number of objects.  After this, your program should print the size of `pool` (to do the latter, you should add a public static method to `Point` to retrieve this size).

**Hint:** The apparent type of `pool` should be changed to:

```
Map<Point, WeakReference<Point>>
```

while the actual type of `pool` should become:
```
WeakHashMap<Point, WeakReference<Point>>
```
