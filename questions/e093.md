## e093: *Average of numbers*

Write a program that prompts the user to enter a positive integer *n*, then asks for *n*
integers to be entered, and prints their average (computed as a `double`).  If the
user enters a non-integer at any point, you should detect this by catching a `NumberFormatException`,
and display a message stating that this input has been ignored.  If the user initially enters a non-positive
integer, you should also detect this and request a positive integer instead.
