## 67dd: *Word count*

Write a Java program that reads from standard input, printing the number of lines, words and alpha-numeric characters
that have been encountered when the end of input is reached.  A word is defined to be a continuous sequence of alpha-numeric characters, so that
`Dog`, `1955` and `a2ps` are each words, while `type-based` is two words.

For example, given the following input:

```
People love me at parties
when they ask me "Oh, you are a computer guy?
Can you fix my laptop?"
And I respond...
"Computer Science is no more about computers
than astronomy is about telescopes"
```

your program should print:

```
Lines: 6
Words: 35
Characters: 149
```

Reading from standard input can be performed as in question [2d33](2d33.md).
