## 7041: *Cloning tree nodes*

\begin{question}{Cloning tree nodes.}\label{question:cloningtreenodes}
Consider again the `TreeNode` class of \questionref{treenodes}---the original class, not your set of improved classes.

Extend `TreeNode` with a `clone()` method that, when invoked on a `TreeNode`
instance, creates and returns a copy of the
subtree rooted at the given node.  All aspects of a node should be cloned, apart from the key, which \textbf{should not} be
cloned.  (Because of this, the result will not be a true ``deep copy'': the copy and the original will share the same key object.
Hence, this copy might actually be called ``semi-deep''.)
