## 7041: *Cloning tree nodes*

Consider again the `TreeNode` class of [question 96df](96df.md)---the original class, not your set of improved classes.

Extend `TreeNode` with a `clone()` method that, when invoked on a `TreeNode`
instance, creates and returns a copy of the
subtree rooted at the given node.  All aspects of a node should be cloned, apart from the key, which **should not** be
cloned.  (Because of this, the result will not be a true "deep copy": the copy and the original will share the same key object.
Hence, this copy might actually be called "semi-deep".)
