## 5235: *Equality between points*

Recall class `Point` from [question 0f05](0f05.md).  If you construct two `Point` objects
with identical coordinates, should they be regarded as *equal*?  This depends on the context in which
you use `Point`, but very likely the answer is *yes*: instances of `Point`
are immutable *value* objects, so that if two `Point`s look identical, they should be regarded
as the same.  (Remember that we call such objects *value* objects because they have some of the
attractive properties of primitive values: in particular, aliasing of value objects is not problematic.  However,
value objects *are still objects*, and comparing two identical value objects with `==` may return
*false*.)

As you know from the lectures, if we construct two identical `Point` objects and compare them
with the `==` operator, the operator will yield *false*, because the points being compared
are not the same object.

What happens if you construct two points, `p` and `q` with identical coordinates, and compare them by testing
whether `p.equals(q)` holds?  Try it.  You should find that the result is also *false*.  Why is this?

Implement `Point` equality testing by overriding the `equals` method from `Object`.  Remember the
recipe for constructing a basic `equals` method:

* Check that the incoming object has the right type, using `instanceof`
* If it does, cast the incoming object to this type
* Compare fields

Test that your implementation works by confirming that a selection of identical points are regarded as being equal,
and that points with differing coordinates are not.

Now create two instances of `ColouredPoint` that have identical coordinates, but *different* colours.
Does your implementation of `equals` regard these objects as being equal, and why does it behave in
this way?  If the `ColouredPoint` objects are regarded as being equal then you should fix this by overriding
`equals` appropriately in `ColouredPoint`.

Finally, consider comparing a (non-coloured) `Point` with a `ColouredPoint.`  Construct a
`Point` `p` and a `ColouredPoint` `cp` such that `p.equals(cp)`
holds, but `cp.equals(p)` *does not* hold.  In other words, demonstrate that the `equals` relation you
have defined is not *symmetric* in the presence of subclasses.  We will return to this issue in [question aa68](aa68.md).
