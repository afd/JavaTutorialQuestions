## 937d: *Flawed rectangle*

The class below models a rectangle shape, which has a particular area.
For the purposes of this question, the inheritance hierarchy that ```Rectangle```
is part of is not important.  Can you detect a design flaw in the class?
Explain what the problem is, and present a better version of the class that fixes
the problem.

* [Rectangle.java](../solutions/code/tutorialquestions/question937d/flawedrectangle/Rectangle.java)

**Hint:** this class should enforce an important invariant that you should
identify.  How does the fact that ```width```, ```height``` and
```area``` can all be modified allow this invariant to be broken?
