## aa68: *Symmetric equality testing*


Recall from the end of \questionref{equality} that you have implemented `equals` in a manner that
is \emph{asymmetric} in the presence of subclasses: you constructed a `Point` `p`
and a `ColouredPoint` `cp` such that `p.equals(cp)` holds, but `cp.equals(p)`
does not.

Think for a while about how to make `equals` work symmetrically in the
presence of subclasses.  If you manage to find an elegant working solution you should feel very happy, as this
confounded Object Oriented Programming practitioners for some time!  If you get stuck, then look at this excellent
article on writing equality methods in Java:

* [How to Write an Equality Method in Java](https://www.artima.com/lejava/articles/equality.html)

The tutorial describes the ``can equal'' approach to defining `equals` in the presence of subclasses.
This is the approach taken by the Scala programming language.  There is a Java school of thought that believes that
one should not override `equals` for classes that may have subclasses.  According to this school of thought,
what are the only kinds of classes for which `equals` should be overridden?
