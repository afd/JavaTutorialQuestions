## dc38: *Email management system*

Imagine you are designing an email management system that needs to manage email addresses.  There are two types of email address: an *individual* address, which identifies a single email inbox, and a *group* address which acts as a container for other addresses.  A group can be a member of other groups; furthermore, a (group or single) address can be a member of several groups.

Write a set of Java classes that models individual and group email addresses.  Your classes should fulfil the following requirements:

* Every email address (individual or group) should have an associated string identifier
* Two email addresses should be regarded as equal if they have the same identifier.  Don't forget that if you override `equals()`, you must also override `hashCode()`
* On construction, a group email address should initially have no members
* It should be possible to add an email address to a group email address
* All email addresses should support a method, `getTargets()`.  When invoked on email address `a`, this method should return the set of individual addresses to which an email addressed to `a` must be sent

First, assume that all group memberships are acyclic; that is, no group can contain itself (directly or indirectly) as a member.

Once you have a working solution for the acyclic scenario, write an extended version that will work even in the presence of cycles.

You should also write a demonstration program to show your classes in action.
