## c822: *Problems cloning tree nodes*

\begin{question}{Problems cloning tree nodes.}\label{question:problemscloningtreenodes}
What happens if you now invoke `n1.clone()`, where `n1` is an object referenced by the following code
fragment and `TreeNode` is the class you produced in \questionref{cloningtreenodes}?

\begin{lstlisting}
TreeNode<String> n1 = new TreeNode<String>(1);
n1.setKey("A");
TreeNode<String> n2 = new TreeNode<String>(1);
n2.setKey("B");
n1.setChild(0, n2);
n2.setChild(0, n1);
\end{lstlisting}

Answer the same question for `n3.clone()`, where `n3` is an object referenced by the following code
fragment:	
		
\begin{lstlisting}
TreeNode<String> n3 = new TreeNode<String>(2);
n3.setKey("C");
TreeNode<String> n4 = new TreeNode<String>(1);
n4.setKey("D");
TreeNode<String> n5 = new TreeNode<String>(0);
n5.setKey("E");
n3.setChild(0, n4);
n3.setChild(1, n5);
n4.setChild(0, n5);
\end{lstlisting}

If your implementation of `clone()` runs into problems on these examples then think
of a precondition on the arguments of `setChild()` that will ensure that subsequent
calls to `clone()` work correctly.  For this exercise, it is enough just to state this
precondition in natural language.  If you are ambitious, you might like to try implementing a
check for the precondition, i.e., an assertion that tests whether the precondition holds on
entry to `setChild()`.
