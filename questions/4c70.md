## 4c70: *Lottery numbers*

In the *Lotto* game, part of the UK's National Lottery, seven distinct numbers are randomly chosen from the set {1, 2, ..., 49}, the seventh being called the *Bonus Number*.  Write a program to simulate this.  An example of your program's output could be:

```
Number 1: 43
Number 2: 28
Number 3: 33
Number 4: 18
Number 5: 11
Number 6: 30
Bonus Number: 6
```

To generate random numbers, you should create an instance of a `Random` object:

```
Random generator = new Random();
```

Then, for a non-negative integer *n*, you can get a random integer between 0 and *n* by calling the `nextInt` method, e.g.:

```
int x = generator.nextInt(n);
```

To use `Random` you need to *import* it, by writing:

```
import java.util.Random;
```

at the top of your file.

The non-trivial aspect of this question is ensuring that the seven Lottery numbers chosen are all distinct.
