## 0c21: *Properties*

Suppose you have been contracted to build a property catalougue application
for an estate agent.  The application should manage the following types of properties:

* houses, which are either detached, semidetached or terraced
* bungalows, which are one storey houses and are also either detached, semidetached or terraced
* flats
* maisonettes, which are flats that take up more than one floor of a house

Write a set of skeleton Java classes and/or interfaces to model the entities in this
application domain.  The idea is to create appropriate classes and interfaces, and define the
relationship between them.  You do *not* need to add any methods to these classes/interfaces,
and you do not need to add any fields *unless* you believe the relationship between the
classes should be captured through composition.

**Hint:** at the top of your inheritance hierarchy there should be a class, `Property`,
from which all properties are descended.

Explain the choices behind your design.

Next, write a `PropertyCollection` class.  An instance of `PropertyCollection` should
hold a set of properties.  `PropertyCollection` should support these methods (at least; you can add
corresponding methods for other property types if you wish):

```
// Add a property to the collection
public void addProperty(Property p);

// Return the set of all houses in the collection
public Set<House> getHouses();

// Return the set of all bungalows in the collection
public Set<Bungalow> getBungalows();

// Return the set of all flats in the collection
public Set<Flat> getFlats();

// Return the set of all maisonettes in the collection
public Set<Maisonette> getMaisonettes();

// Return the set of all terraced houses in the collection
public Set<TeracedHouse> getTerracedHouses();
```

There are two ways you can implement these methods.  One way is to use `instanceof`
to test the type of each property.  The other way is to add (possibly abstract) methods `isHouse()`, `isBungalow()`,
`isFlat()`, etc., to `Property` and then override these methods in the various property subclasses
to return appropriate boolean values.  Explain the pros and cons of each approach, decide which to use, and write a justification
of your choice.

Finally, write a `PropertyDemo` class with a `main` method.
The `main` method should create a property collection, and add to it
the following:

* 1000 semi-detached houses
* 1000 terraced houses
* 100 detached houses
* 100 semi-detached bungalows
* 100 flats
* 20 maisonettes
* 20 detached bungalows
* 20 terraced bungalows

where the houses and flats are not bungalows or maisonettes, respectively.

After this, the `main` method should use the methods you have
implemented in `PropertyCollection` to check (using assertions) that the collection
contains:

* 2240 houses
* 140 bungalows
* 120 flats
* 20 maisonettes
* 1020 terraced houses

where bungalows and maisonettes are regarded as being houses and flats,
respectively.
