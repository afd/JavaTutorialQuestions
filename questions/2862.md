## 2862: *Exceptions and inheritance (ii)*

Consider the following Java classes:

[MyExceptionC.java](../solutions/code/tutorialquestions/question2862/MyExceptionC.java)

[MyExceptionD.java](../solutions/code/tutorialquestions/question2862/MyExceptionD.java)

[A.java](../solutions/code/tutorialquestions/question2862/A.java)

[B.java](../solutions/code/tutorialquestions/question2862/B.java)

These classes compile, even though `foo()` in `B` throws a different exception from `foo()` in `A`.  Explain why
the classes compile despite this difference.

Suppose we removed `@Override` from `foo()` in `B`, added

```
import java.io.IOException;
```

to the top of class `B` and changed the declaration of `foo()` in `B` to:

```
void foo() throws IOException {
  throw new IOException();
}
```

Would the classes still compile?  What does your answer tell you about the role of exceptions in method *overloading* in Java?

Finally, with the original set of classes, suppose we added this demo class:

```
public class Demo {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    A myB = new B();
    try {
      myB.foo();
    } catch (MyExceptionD e) {
      System.out.println("Exception of type MyExceptionD was thrown.");
    }
  }
}
```

Explain why this class will fail to compile.  Explain what simple change you can make to `Demo` to solve the problem.
