## 8f65: *Lucky battling fighters with inheritance*


Recall *Battling fighters* and *Lucky battling fighters*, Questions 8 and 9 from Sheet 1, respectively.  In Question 9
of Sheet 1 you were asked to rewrite your `Fighter` class as `LuckyFighter` to incorporate the notion of luck.

This design choice forces *all* fighters to have the *luck* attribute, and to be equipped with a strategy for
using luck in battles.  We cannot easily mix fighters with luck with fighters without luck.

Your task now is to define `LuckyFighter` as a *subclass* of `Fighter`, extending a `Fighter`
with the *luck* and *strategy* attributes.  You should design your classes so that it is possible to
create a `Fighter` and a `LuckyFighter`, and schedule a battle between them directly.

If Joe is a `Fighter` and Alex a `LuckyFighter` then a battle might look something like this:

\begin{scriptsize}
```

Joe - Human Warrior - skill: 16; stamina: 12
Alex - Defensive Elf Lord - skill: 18; stamina: 6; luck: 11
