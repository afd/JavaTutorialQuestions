## 5d30: *Unreliable buffered reader*

\begin{question}{Unreliable buffered reader.} **Disclaimer:** In this question, you are going to sabotage the behaviour of
class `BufferedReader` by extending it with an unreliable subclass.  As with \questionsref{stack}{heap}, the purpose
of this is to provide more practice working with exceptions in Java.  Clearly you should never do something like this in practice!

Write a class `UnreliableBufferedReader` which extends `BufferedReader` from the `java.io`
package.  An `UnreliableBufferedReader` should have two fields: `probabilityOfError`, of type `double`,
and a random number generator field of type `Random`.

The constructor of `UnreliableBufferedReader` should accept a `double` parameter, and should assign the value
of this parameter to `probabilityOfError` if it lies between 0 and 1 (inclusive).  Otherwise the parameter should be ``clamped''
into the range [0,1]: a negative value should result in `probabilityOfError` being set to 0; a value greater than 1 should result
in `probabilityOfError` being set to 1.  The random number generator should also be constructed.

Override the `readLine` method of `BufferedReader`.  Your overridden version of this method should invoke the superclass
method to read a line, storing a reference to the resulting string in a local variable.  Then our method should choose a random `double`
between 0 and 1.  If the chosen double is less than `probabilityOfError` your method should throw an `IOException` with
the message: ``Error occurred on input stream''.  Otherwise, your overriden version of `readLine` should return the line that was
obtained via the superclass call.

Write a demonstration class to illustrate that your unreliable buffered reader is ``working'' (i.e., not working very well!).  Your demonstration
program should repeatedly read lines from standard input using an `UnreliableBufferedReader`, using a probability of your choice.
The program should terminate when five lines have been successfully read, at which point you should display the number of calls to
`readLine` that were required.

An example session with your program might look like this:

\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{verbatim}
Attempting to read input from unreliable reader...
