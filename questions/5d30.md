## 5d30: *Unreliable buffered reader*

**Disclaimer:** In this question, you are going to sabotage the behaviour of
class `BufferedReader` by extending it with an unreliable subclass.  The purpose
of this is to provide more practice working with exceptions in Java.  Clearly you should never do something like this in practice!

Write a class `UnreliableBufferedReader` which extends `BufferedReader` from the `java.io`
package.  An `UnreliableBufferedReader` should have two fields: `probabilityOfError`, of type `double`,
and a random number generator field of type `Random`.

The constructor of `UnreliableBufferedReader` should accept a `double` parameter, and should assign the value
of this parameter to `probabilityOfError` if it lies between 0 and 1 (inclusive).  Otherwise the parameter should be "clamped"
into the range [0,1]: a negative value should result in `probabilityOfError` being set to 0; a value greater than 1 should result
in `probabilityOfError` being set to 1.  The random number generator should also be constructed.

Override the `readLine` method of `BufferedReader`.  Your overridden version of this method should invoke the superclass
method to read a line, storing a reference to the resulting string in a local variable.  Then our method should choose a random `double`
between 0 and 1.  If the chosen double is less than `probabilityOfError` your method should throw an `IOException` with
the message: "Error occurred on input stream".  Otherwise, your overriden version of `readLine` should return the line that was
obtained via the superclass call.

Write a demonstration class to illustrate that your unreliable buffered reader is "working" (i.e., not working very well!).  Your demonstration
program should repeatedly read lines from standard input using an `UnreliableBufferedReader`, using a probability of your choice.
The program should terminate when five lines have been successfully read, at which point you should display the number of calls to
`readLine` that were required.

An example session with your program might look like this:

```
Attempting to read input from unreliable reader...
Hello
