## 0f05: *Coloured points*

Write a class, `Point`, representing a point in 3-dimensional Euclidean space.  You should ensure that objects of type
`Point` are \emph{immutable}.  That is, once a `Point` has been created, its fields cannot be modified further.

Your class should provide the following:

\begin{itemize}

\item a method that takes a `Point` parameter and returns the Euclidean distance between
this parameter and the `Point` on which the method is called

\item a method that returns a `Point` representing the origin

\item a method that returns the \emph{magnitude} of a `Point` -- that is, its distance from the origin

\end{itemize}

In addition, you should override the `toString()` method provided by `Object` to provide
an appropriate string representation of a `Point`.

Write some tests to make sure your class is working as expected.

Now write a new class, `ColouredPoint`, that extends `Point` to provide an additional
\emph{colour} field.  It is up to you whether you represent colour using an enumeration of several permissible
colours, using integer values for \emph{red}, \emph{green} and \emph{blue}, or some other way.  You should override `toString()` to represent
a `ColouredPoint` as a string by showing its coordinates followed by a string representation of its colour value.  You should \emph{not} repeat the
code used to represent a point's coordinates as a string: this string representation should be achieved via
the `toString()` method in `Point`.
