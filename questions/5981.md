## 5981: *Shapes*


Assume you are writing an application that needs to work with the following types of
shapes:

* ellipse (the size of which can be defined by its semimajor and semiminor axes)
* circle (the size of which can be defined by its radius)
* rectangle (the size of which can be defined by its width and height)
* square (the size of which can be defined by the length of its side)

Create a set of Java classes that represents these shapes.  Your representation should
enable the following functionality:

* For each shape, it should be possible to retrieve and change its size
* Given a set of shapes, it should be possible to identify all squares
* Given a set of shapes, it should be possible to identify all circles

**Hint:** This question is not as obvious as it may seem.  It is natural to represent
rectangles with a class `Rectangle` which contains fields `width`
and `height`.  Consider now what happens if someone creates an instance of
`Rectangle` whose width is 60 and height is 70; however, he/she later changes
the height to be 60.
