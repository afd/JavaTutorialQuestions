## 5981: *Shapes*


Assume you are writing an application that needs to work with the following types of
shapes:

\begin{itemize}
\item ellipse (the size of which can be defined by its semimajor and semiminor axes)
\item circle (the size of which can be defined by its radius)
\item rectangle (the size of which can be defined by its width and height)
\item square (the size of which can be defined by the length of its side)
\end{itemize}

Create a set of Java classes that represents these shapes.  Your representation should
enable the following functionality:

\begin{itemize}
\item For each shape, it should be possible to retrieve and change its size
\item Given a set of shapes, it should be possible to identify all squares
\item Given a set of shapes, it should be possible to identify all circles
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Hint:} This question is not as obvious as it may seem.  It is natural to represent
rectangles with a class \lstinline{Rectangle} which contains fields \lstinline{width}
and \lstinline{height}.  Consider now what happens if someone creates an instance of
\lstinline{Rectangle} whose width is 60 and height is 70; however, he/she later changes
the height to be 60.
