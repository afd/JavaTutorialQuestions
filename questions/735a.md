## 735a: *Generic iterators*

\begin{question}{Generic iterators.} \emph{Note:} even if you did not attempt Questions \questionref 15 and
16 of Sheet 3, you should still be able to attempt this question by starting with the Sheet 3 sample
solutions.

In Question 15 and Question 16 of Sheet 3 you were asked to add the
`StringStackIterator` and `IntSetIterator` interfaces to your
collection of string stack and int set classes, respectively.  Your task was then to
add an `iterator`
method to the `StringStack` and `IntSet` interfaces, and provide
implementations of `StringStackIterator` for each type
of string stack (resulting in `StringStackArrayIterator` and `StringStackListIterator`)
and `IntSetIterator` for each type of int set (resulting in `MemoryEfficientIntSetIterator` and `SpeedEfficientIntSetIterator`)
respectively.

Your task is now to do something analogous for the `GenericStack` and `GenericSet` interfaces
and implementing classes that you have defined in \questionsref{genericstacks}{genericsets}.  This should be
a straightforward case of cutting and pasting the iterators from Sheet 3 (either from your solution or the sample solution)
and changing the definitions to be generic, rather than string/integer specific.

This should lead to the generic interfaces `GenericStackIterator` and `GenericSetIterator`, together
with four implementing classes: one for each of the kinds of stack and set.

You should find that the `GenericStackIterator` and `GenericSetIterator` interfaces are \emph{identical}.
Improve your design to eliminate this duplication by replacing these interfaces with a \emph{single} `GenericIterator` interface.

\vspace{1mm}
\textbf{Extension:} Interfaces `GenericStack` and `GenericSet` have the common method `iterator()`.
Abstract this duplication by creating a unifying interface, `GenericCollection`, that offers the `iterator()`
method, and make `GenericStack` and `GenericSet` both extend your new interface.
