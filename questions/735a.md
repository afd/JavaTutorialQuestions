## 735a: *Generic iterators*

*Note:* If you had trouble with questions [85bb](85bb.md) or [a6e7](a6e7.md) you could uses the sample solutions for those questions as a guide when completing this question.

In questions [85bb](85bb.md) and [a6e7](a6e7.md) you were asked to add the
`StringStackIterator` and `IntSetIterator` interfaces to your
collection of string stack and int set classes, respectively.  Your task was then to
add an `iterator`
method to the `StringStack` and `IntSet` interfaces, and provide
implementations of `StringStackIterator` for each type
of string stack (resulting in `StringStackArrayIterator` and `StringStackListIterator`)
and `IntSetIterator` for each type of int set (resulting in `MemoryEfficientIntSetIterator` and `SpeedEfficientIntSetIterator`)
respectively.

Your task is now to do something analogous for the `GenericStack` and `GenericSet` interfaces
and implementing classes that you have defined in [question b401](b401.md).  This should be
a straightforward case of cutting and pasting the iterators from question [85bb](85bb.md)/[a6e7](a6e7.md) (either from your solution or the sample solution)
and changing the definitions to be generic, rather than string/integer specific.

This should lead to the generic interfaces `GenericStackIterator` and `GenericSetIterator`, together
with four implementing classes: one for each of the kinds of stack and set.

You should find that the `GenericStackIterator` and `GenericSetIterator` interfaces are *identical*.
Improve your design to eliminate this duplication by replacing these interfaces with a *single* `GenericIterator` interface.

**Extension:** Interfaces `GenericStack` and `GenericSet` have the common method `iterator()`.
Abstract this duplication by creating a unifying interface, `GenericCollection`, that offers the `iterator()`
method, and make `GenericStack` and `GenericSet` both extend your new interface.
