## 735a: *Generic iterators*

\begin{question}{Generic iterators.} \emph{Note:} even if you did not attempt Questions \questionref 15 and
16 of Sheet 3, you should still be able to attempt this question by starting with the Sheet 3 sample
solutions.

In Question 15 and Question 16 of Sheet 3 you were asked to add the
\lstinline{StringStackIterator} and \lstinline{IntSetIterator} interfaces to your
collection of string stack and int set classes, respectively.  Your task was then to
add an \lstinline{iterator}
method to the \lstinline{StringStack} and \lstinline{IntSet} interfaces, and provide
implementations of \lstinline{StringStackIterator} for each type
of string stack (resulting in \lstinline{StringStackArrayIterator} and \lstinline{StringStackListIterator})
and \lstinline{IntSetIterator} for each type of int set (resulting in \lstinline{MemoryEfficientIntSetIterator} and \lstinline{SpeedEfficientIntSetIterator})
respectively.

Your task is now to do something analogous for the \lstinline{GenericStack} and \lstinline{GenericSet} interfaces
and implementing classes that you have defined in \questionsref{genericstacks}{genericsets}.  This should be
a straightforward case of cutting and pasting the iterators from Sheet 3 (either from your solution or the sample solution)
and changing the definitions to be generic, rather than string/integer specific.

This should lead to the generic interfaces \lstinline{GenericStackIterator} and \lstinline{GenericSetIterator}, together
with four implementing classes: one for each of the kinds of stack and set.

You should find that the \lstinline{GenericStackIterator} and \lstinline{GenericSetIterator} interfaces are \emph{identical}.
Improve your design to eliminate this duplication by replacing these interfaces with a \emph{single} \lstinline{GenericIterator} interface.

\vspace{1mm}
\textbf{Extension:} Interfaces \lstinline{GenericStack} and \lstinline{GenericSet} have the common method \lstinline{iterator()}.
Abstract this duplication by creating a unifying interface, \lstinline{GenericCollection}, that offers the \lstinline{iterator()}
method, and make \lstinline{GenericStack} and \lstinline{GenericSet} both extend your new interface.
