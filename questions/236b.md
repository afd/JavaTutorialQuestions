## 236b: *Fields for properties*

Extend the classes you designed in \questionref{houses} with data fields that capture the following
information for each property:

* the number of bedrooms
* the number of reception rooms
* the number of bathrooms
* the square footage of the property

You can assume that all of this information will be present for all property types.
You should carefully determine which class/classes should store this information.
Explain why you chose to model this data as you did.
