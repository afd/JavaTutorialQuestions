## 236b: *Fields for properties*

\begin{question}{.}
Extend the classes you designed in \questionref{houses} with data fields that capture the following
information for each property:
\begin{itemize}
\item the number of bedrooms
\item the number of reception rooms
\item the number of bathrooms
\item the square footage of the property
\end{itemize}

You can assume that all of this information will be present for all property types.
You should carefully determine which class/classes should store this information.
Explain why you chose to model this data as you did.
