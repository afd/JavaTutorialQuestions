## 2d33: *Reversed order of input*

Write a program that reads a series of lines from standard input,
then prints out these lines in reversed order.

You should first implement a version of this program that reads lines of input into an array of strings,
making the assumption that input will consist of 100 lines or fewer.  You should then implement a more flexible
version of this program where the number of input lines is not bounded, by storing input in a `Deque` object
as explained below.

You can read from standard input one line at a time using a `BufferedReader` object.  To create a `BufferedReader`, add:

```
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.io.IOException;
```

to the top of your Java file, and then write:

``
BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
```

in your `main` method.

To read a line from standard input into a string, `line`, do:

```
line = br.readLine();
```

Because it is possible, in exceptional cases, for input reading to go wrong, the `readLine` method can throw an *exception*.
We will cover exceptions later in the course.  For now, to allow your program to compile, you should declare `main` as follows:

```
public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException { ...
```

This means that if an exception does occur due to `readLine`, your program will exit and details of the exception will be displayed on the terminal.

The `readLine` method will return `null` when the end of input is reached.  So, to loop until all input has been consumed, you can
write something like:

```
public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {

  BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
  String line = br.readLine();
  while (line != null) {
    ... /* Do something with 'line' */
    line = br.readLine();
  }

}
```

For the second part of the question, you can use the `Deque` interface from the Java library, which must be imported:

```
import java.util.Deque;
```

*Deque* (pronounced ``deck'') stands for *double-ended queue*, and provides the functionality of a *stack*:
*push* and *pop* operations, to add/remove an item to/from the front of the queue are supported.
`Deque` is a *generic* interface: it makes sense to have a deque of integers, a deque of strings, a deque of cars, etc.
`Deque` is implemented by various classes, including `ArrayDeque`, which you should use for this example.
To create an empty deque of strings, you can do:

```
Deque<String> myDeque = new ArrayDeque<>();
```

Remember that the `<String>` part of this definition specifies that the data to be stored in this deque has type `String`.

To add a string to the top of the deque, call `push`.  E.g.:

```
myDeque.push("Hello");
String myString = "Another String";
myDeque.push(myString);
```

To copy the top element of the deque into a variable, and have it removed from the deque, call `pop`.  E.g.:

```
String myString = myDeque.pop();
```
