## 7206: *Understanding references*

Consider the following classes:

* [Book.java](../solutions/code/tutorialquestions/question7206/Book.java)
* [PrintBook.java](../solutions/code/tutorialquestions/question7206/PrintBook.java)

What does ```main``` in ```PrintBook``` cause to be printed to standard
output?

**Note:** The point of this question is that you should try to figure this out
*without* simply typing in the program and running it!  (Though you can of course
do this to check your answer.)
