The \lstinline{StringStackArray} class implementation is straightforward: see the sample solution.

The \lstinline{StringStackList} class implementation is even more straightforward; perhaps so straightforward you may have
worried that you were missing something!  Look at the sample solution.  The only slightly tricky part is implementing \lstinline{pop()}
so that the last element of the list is removed.

You will see in the sample solution that \lstinline{StringStackArray} and \lstinline{StringStackList} both implement
the \lstinline{StringStack} interface.  Notice that the interface methods are declared public.  This is not actually
necessary, as they are \emph{implicitly} public.  However, it does no harm.  The implementations of these methods in
\lstinline{StringStackArray} and \lstinline{StringStackList} must be declared public regardless.

See how simple the implementation of \lstinline{transferStacks} in \emph{Demo.java} is:

\begin{lstlisting}
public static void transferStacks(StringStack dst, StringStack src) {
  while(!src.isEmpty()) {
    dst.push(src.pop());
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

Because we have a \lstinline{StringStack} interface, we can write this method purely in terms of the interface
type, regardless of the classes that provide actual types for \lstinline{src} and \lstinline{dst}.

The power of this is illustrated in \lstinline{main}, where we can write:

\begin{lstlisting}
StringStack first = new StringStackArray();
StringStack second = new StringStackList();
...
transferStacks(second, first);
\end{lstlisting}

Polymorphism here allows us to treat a \lstinline{StringStackArray} and a \lstinline{StringStackList} \emph{uniformly}
as objects of type \lstinline{StringStack} when we call \lstinline{transferStacks}.  Note that it would also work if we wrote:

\begin{lstlisting}
StringStackArray first = new StringStackArray();
StringStackList second = new StringStackList();
...
transferStacks(second, first);
\end{lstlisting}

In this case, the compiler \emph{upcasts} \lstinline{first} and \lstinline{second} to \lstinline{StringStack} when \lstinline{transferStacks} is called.

Finally, if we want to change \lstinline{StringStackList} to use a \lstinline{LinkedList} instead of an \lstinline{ArrayList}, we need only change:
\begin{lstlisting}
elements = new ArrayList<String>();
\end{lstlisting}
to
\begin{lstlisting}
elements = new LinkedList<String>();
\end{lstlisting}
in the constructor of \lstinline{StringStackList}.
