## Solution to [b4a5](../questions/b4a5): *Observing the garbage collector*

See code at `solutions/code/tutorialquestions/questionb4a5`

\begin{question}{Observing the garbage collector}\label{question:gc}
The package-visible static field in class `A` should be declared as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}
static int numCollected = 0;
\end{lstlisting}

---remember that default visibility is package visibility.

The `finalize` method in my solution looks like this:

\begin{lstlisting}
	@Override
	public void finalize() {
		System.out.println("Instance " + id + " collected");
		numCollected++;
	}
\end{lstlisting}

Note that I have marked this method with `@Override` because `finalize` is provided by the `Object` class.  Note also that incrementing `numCollected`
increments the *static* field `numCollected`, thus this change is visible to *all* objects of type `A`: because the field is declared static, its value is
shared across the class.

My `main` method looks like this:

\begin{lstlisting}
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		for(int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
			new A(i);
		}
		
		System.out.println("Number of instances of A garbage-collected: " + A.numCollected);
		
	}
\end{lstlisting}

I ran this three times on my desktop, and here is an abbreviated version of the last few lines of output generated by each run:

\noindent\textbf{Run 1:}
\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{verbatim}
Instance 263256 collected
Instance 263255 collected
Instance 263254 collected
Number of instances of A garbage-collected: 28347
Instance 263253 collected

...
Instance 263228 collected
Instance 263227 collected
Instance 263226 collected
\end{verbatim}
\end{scriptsize}

\noindent\textbf{Run 2:}
\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{verbatim}

Instance 495432 collected

...
Instance 495415 collected
Instance 495414 collected
Instance 495413 collected
\end{verbatim}
\end{scriptsize}

\vspace{1mm}
\noindent\textbf{Run 3:}
\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{verbatim}
Instance 523514 collected
Instance 802356 collected
Instance 523515 collected
Number of instances of A garbage-collected: 25859
Instance 802352 collected
Instance 523519 collected
Instance 802334 collected
Instance 523537 collected
Instance 802333 collected
\end{verbatim}
\end{scriptsize}

From this, we learn the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item The garbage collector does not necessarily collect all garbage produced by the program before the program terminates.  In this program, I created 1000000 garbage objects of type A, but in each run fewer than 40000 of them were garbage collected.  (Of course, when your program terminates, all the memory it used becomes is reclaimed by the operating system, so this is not a problem.)

\item Different numbers of objects are garbage-collected during different runs of the program

\item There is no guarantee about the order in which objects will be garbage-collected: this varies run-to-run

\item As a result of this, there is no guarantee as to when, if at all, `finalize` will be invoked for an object that becomes garbage

\end{itemize}
