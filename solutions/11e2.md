## Solution to [b33f](../questions/11e2.md): *Bounded generic methods with streams*

See code at `solutions/code/tutorialquestions/question11e2`

Compare the sample source code for this question with your solution.

The signature of the method is:

      public static <E, C extends Collection<E>> Optional<C> getSmallestCollection(List<C> collections);

Unpicking this a bit, the `E` is the element type of the collections in the list of collections.  A simpler method signature is:

      public static <E> Optional<Collection<E>> getSmallestCollection(List<Collection<E>> collections);

but this only works if we pass in a `List<Collection<E>>`; we cannot pass in a `List<Set<E>>` for example.

The purpose of `C extends Collection<E>` is to say that "`C` is any type that is a subtype of `Collection<E>`, or `Collection<E>` itself".  The true method signature is the same as the simplified method signature, except that `C extends Collection<E>` is introduced right after `E` is introduced, and then `C` is used instead of `Collection<E>` thereafter.

The solution has a couple of comments starting: "Think about why ..." -- take a look at these and have a think!
