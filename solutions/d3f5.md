## Solution to [d3f5](../questions/d3f5.md): *Streams and downcasting*

See code at `solutions/code/tutorialquestions/questiond3f5`

Observe the use of `filter` to first filter the stream to get just those elements of type `Integer`, and then `map` to actually get a `Stream<Integer>` instead of a `Stream<Number>`.  The reason we need to use `map` after `filter`, even though `map` is a no-op, is that `filter` takes a `Stream<T>` and returns a `Stream<T>`, so given a `Stream<Number>` it returns a `Stream<Number>`.  If we removed the `map` step, the second `filter`, where we filter those elements whose values are not positive, would not compile since we cannot ask "`n > 0`" when `n` is an arbitrary `Number`.

We are not allowed to invoke `restrictToPositiveIntegers` on a `Stream<Float>` or a `Stream<Integer>` because in Java, if `B` is a subtype of `A` (e.g. `B` is `Float` and `A` is `Number`), it does not follow that `C<B>` is a subtype of `C<A>` -- in particular it does not follow that `Stream<B>` is a subtype of `Stream<A>`, so `Stream<Float>` is not a subtype of `Stream<Integer>`.

The method `restrictToPositiveIntegersBoundedWildcard` has this signature:

      static Stream<Integer> restrictToPositiveIntegersBoundedWildcard(Stream<? extends Number> numbers);

The use of a *bounded wildcard* in the signature of `restrictToPositiveIntegersBoundedWildcard` solves the problem: `Stream<? extends Number>` is compatible with `Stream<Float>` and `Stream<Integer>` because `Float` extends `Number` and `Integer` extends `Number`.

Have a look at the `main` method in the solution and check that your solution exhibits similar behaviour.
