\begin{question}{Properties.}\label{question:houses}
%
The point of this question was to demonstrate that thinking about inheritance hierarchies, and specifically
how to map them to a single-inheritance language like Java, can be challenging.  There are multiple feasible
solutions to this question.

\end{figure}


First, let us consider in some sense the ``ideal'' UML diagram for the desired inheritance hierarchy.
This is shown in \figref{original}.  The hierarchy captures the ``is-a'' relationships described in
the question.  \lstinline{Property}, \lstinline{House} and \lstinline{Bungalow} are abstract, because
the question indicated that all houses and bungalows should be one one of \emph{detached}, \emph{semi-detached}
or \emph{terraced}.  Note that \lstinline{Flat} is \emph{not} abstract: the question indicated that a maisonette
is a special kind of flat, but this implied that regular flats should exist.

Multiple inheritance creeps in because \lstinline{DetachedBungalow} inherits from both \lstinline{DetachedHouse}
and \lstinline{Bungalow}.

Because we cannot have multiple inheritance in Java, we need to find a way to simulate this using interfaces.
In my mind there are two reasonable ways to do this:

\begin{itemize}

\item Make \lstinline{Bungalow} an interface, which the bungalow properties implement, as well as extending their respective
\lstinline{House} subclasses.  This is what the sample solution does; the UML is shown in \figref{solution} and the Java
classes are available in the \lstinline{instanceofsolution} package (the name of this package reflects a later part of the solution; see below).

\item Make interfaces \lstinline{Detached}, \lstinline{SemiDetached} and \lstinline{Terraced}.  Keep \lstinline{Bungalow} as an abstract
class that extends \lstinline{House}.  Then have \lstinline{DetachedHouse} extend \lstinline{House} and implement \lstinline{Detached},
and have \lstinline{DetachedBungalow} extend \lstinline{Bungalow} and implement \lstinline{Detached} (the setup for the semi-detached
and terraced property types is analogous).  You might benefit from drawing the UML class diagram for this arrangement.

\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

In the sample solution I have implemented \lstinline{PropertyCollection} methods in two ways: using \lstinline{instnaceof}
to test the actual types of properties (see package \lstinline{instanceofsolution}) and by adding methods
\lstinline{isHouse()}, \lstinline{isBungalow()},
\lstinline{isFlat()}, etc., to \lstinline{Property} and using these methods to test the type of a property.

The \lstinline{instanceof} approach has the advantage that it does not pollute the \lstinline{Property} class
hierarchy with lots of extra methods.  It seems a shame for an arbitrary property to have to provide
a method saying whether or not it is a maisonette!  On the other hand, the method-based approach is more flexible, and provides
better encapsulation.
Suppose we wished to change our inheritance hierarchy a bit, by adding or removing some classes, or by changing their names.
This would cause client code that queries object types using \lstinline{instanceof} to break, while calls to the \lstinline{isHouse()}, etc.,
method would still work (because these methods are defined at the abstract level of \lstinline{Property}).

\end{question}
