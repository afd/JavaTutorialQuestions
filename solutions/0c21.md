\begin{question}{Properties.}\label{question:houses}
%
The point of this question was to demonstrate that thinking about inheritance hierarchies, and specifically
how to map them to a single-inheritance language like Java, can be challenging.  There are multiple feasible
solutions to this question.

First, let us consider in some sense the ``ideal'' UML diagram for the desired inheritance hierarchy.
This is shown in \figref{original}.  The hierarchy captures the ``is-a'' relationships described in
the question.  `Property`, `House` and `Bungalow` are abstract, because
the question indicated that all houses and bungalows should be one one of \emph{detached}, \emph{semi-detached}
or \emph{terraced}.  Note that `Flat` is \emph{not} abstract: the question indicated that a maisonette
is a special kind of flat, but this implied that regular flats should exist.

Multiple inheritance creeps in because `DetachedBungalow` inherits from both `DetachedHouse`
and `Bungalow`.

Because we cannot have multiple inheritance in Java, we need to find a way to simulate this using interfaces.
In my mind there are two reasonable ways to do this:

\begin{itemize}

\item Make `Bungalow` an interface, which the bungalow properties implement, as well as extending their respective
`House` subclasses.  This is what the sample solution does; the UML is shown in \figref{solution} and the Java
classes are available in the `instanceofsolution` package (the name of this package reflects a later part of the solution; see below).

\item Make interfaces `Detached`, `SemiDetached` and `Terraced`.  Keep `Bungalow` as an abstract
class that extends `House`.  Then have `DetachedHouse` extend `House` and implement `Detached`,
and have `DetachedBungalow` extend `Bungalow` and implement `Detached` (the setup for the semi-detached
and terraced property types is analogous).  You might benefit from drawing the UML class diagram for this arrangement.

\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

In the sample solution I have implemented `PropertyCollection` methods in two ways: using `instnaceof`
to test the actual types of properties (see package `instanceofsolution`) and by adding methods
`isHouse()`, `isBungalow()`,
`isFlat()`, etc., to `Property` and using these methods to test the type of a property.

The `instanceof` approach has the advantage that it does not pollute the `Property` class
hierarchy with lots of extra methods.  It seems a shame for an arbitrary property to have to provide
a method saying whether or not it is a maisonette!  On the other hand, the method-based approach is more flexible, and provides
better encapsulation.
Suppose we wished to change our inheritance hierarchy a bit, by adding or removing some classes, or by changing their names.
This would cause client code that queries object types using `instanceof` to break, while calls to the `isHouse()`, etc.,
method would still work (because these methods are defined at the abstract level of `Property`).
