\begin{question}{Coloured points.}\label{question:points}
Inspect the sample solution carefully and check you understand it.  Note that in the
constructor of \lstinline{ColouredPoint}, \lstinline{super(coordX, coordY, coordZ)} is used to invoke
the constructor of \lstinline{Point}, after which \lstinline{this.colour = colour}
assigns to the additional \lstinline{colour} field.  This pattern of building subclass
constructors is standard.

Look at the \lstinline{toString} method in \lstinline{ColouredPoint}.  Observe that
\lstinline{@Override} has been used to indicate that this should override a superclass
method.  If we accidentally mis-spelled \lstinline{toString}, thus \emph{not} overriding
the parent method, the use of \lstinline{@Override} would generate a useful compiler error.
Look at the way \lstinline{super.toString()} is used in the body of \lstinline{toString()}.
