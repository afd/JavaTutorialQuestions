## Solution to [0f05](../questions/0f05): *Coloured points*

See code at `solutions/code/tutorialquestions/question0f05`

Inspect the sample solution carefully and check you understand it.  Note that in the
constructor of `ColouredPoint`, `super(coordX, coordY, coordZ)` is used to invoke
the constructor of `Point`, after which `this.colour = colour`
assigns to the additional `colour` field.  This pattern of building subclass
constructors is standard.

Look at the `toString` method in `ColouredPoint`.  Observe that
`@Override` has been used to indicate that this should override a superclass
method.  If we accidentally mis-spelled `toString`, thus *not* overriding
the parent method, the use of `@Override` would generate a useful compiler error.
Look at the way `super.toString()` is used in the body of `toString()`.
