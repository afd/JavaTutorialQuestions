## Solution to [290b](../questions/290b): *Memory leaks in Java*

See code at `solutions/code/tutorialquestions/question290b`

\begin{question}{Memory leaks in Java.}
See \lstinline{standardreferences.Demo} for a program that causes an ``out of memory'' error.

The \lstinline{Point} class in the \lstinline{weakreferences} package shows how Java's
\lstinline{WeakReference} and \lstinline{WeakHashMap} classes can be used to avoid the
memory leak problem.  The \lstinline{pool} map is changed so that it maps \lstinline{Point}
objects to \lstinline{WeakReference<Point>} objects.  Furthermore, \lstinline{point} is
instantiated to be a \lstinline{WeakHashMap} rather than a \lstinline{HashMap}.

In \lstinline{makePoint}, the line:

\begin{lstlisting}
pool.put(p, p);
\end{lstlisting}
%
is changed to:
\begin{lstlisting}
pool.put(p, new WeakReference<Point>(p));
\end{lstlisting}
%
---the reference \lstinline{p} specified as the \emph{value} part of the map entry is
wrapped in a \lstinline{WeakReference}.

The result
of this is that if a \lstinline{Point} object is only active because it is a member of
\lstinline{pool}, it is allowed to be garbage-collected.

Class \lstinline{weakreferences.Demo} demonstrates that this solution works by creating 
a vast number of distinct \lstinline{Point} objects, but not keeping a reference to any 
of them.  Because of the use of weak references in the implementation of object pooling,
these objects will eventually be garbage-collected, so memory is not exhausted.

\end{question}
