## Solution to [290b](../questions/290b): *Memory leaks in Java*

See code at `solutions/code/tutorialquestions/question290b`

See `standardreferences.Demo` for a program that causes an "out of memory" error.

The `Point` class in the `weakreferences` package shows how Java's
`WeakReference` and `WeakHashMap` classes can be used to avoid the
memory leak problem.  The `pool` map is changed so that it maps `Point`
objects to `WeakReference<Point>` objects.  Furthermore, `point` is
instantiated to be a `WeakHashMap` rather than a `HashMap`.

In `makePoint`, the line:

```
pool.put(p, p);
```

is changed to:
```
pool.put(p, new WeakReference<Point>(p));
```

---the reference `p` specified as the *value* part of the map entry is
wrapped in a `WeakReference`.

The result
of this is that if a `Point` object is only active because it is a member of
`pool`, it is allowed to be garbage-collected.

Class `weakreferences.Demo` demonstrates that this solution works by creating 
a vast number of distinct `Point` objects, but not keeping a reference to any 
of them.  Because of the use of weak references in the implementation of object pooling,
these objects will eventually be garbage-collected, so memory is not exhausted.
