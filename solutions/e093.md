## Solution to [e093](../questions/e093): *Average of numbers*

See code at `solutions/code/tutorialquestions/questione093`

In the solution I define a class \lstinline{IntegerReader} that can be used to read integers, and also specifically
\emph{positive} integers, from standard input.  Method \lstinline{readInteger} uses a \lstinline{BufferedReader} to repeatedly read lines from standard input until a line consisting of simply an integer is entered.  The method uses \lstinline{Integer.parseInt} to try to convert a line of input to an integer.
If the line is \emph{not} an integer, an \lstinline{NumberFormatException} will be thrown.  This is immediately caught, and a message is displayed asking the
user to enter something that is actually an integer.

The class also declares \lstinline{readPositiveInteger}, which repeatedly calls \lstinline{readInteger} until a positive integer is entered.  Notice the use
of a \lstinline{for} loop of the form:

\begin{lstlisting}
for(;;) {
  ...
}
\end{lstlisting}
in \lstinline{readPositiveInteger}.
