## Solution to [e093](../questions/e093): *Average of numbers*

See code at `solutions/code/tutorialquestions/questione093`

In the solution I define a class `IntegerReader` that can be used to read integers, and also specifically
*positive* integers, from standard input.  Method `readInteger` uses a `BufferedReader` to repeatedly read lines from standard input until a line consisting of simply an integer is entered.  The method uses `Integer.parseInt` to try to convert a line of input to an integer.
If the line is *not* an integer, an `NumberFormatException` will be thrown.  This is immediately caught, and a message is displayed asking the
user to enter something that is actually an integer.

The class also declares `readPositiveInteger`, which repeatedly calls `readInteger` until a positive integer is entered.  Notice the use
of a `for` loop of the form:

```
for(;;) {
  ...
}
```

in `readPositiveInteger`.
