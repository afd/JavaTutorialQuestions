## Solution to [8f65](../questions/8f65): *Lucky battling fighters with inheritance*

See code at `solutions/code/tutorialquestions/question8f65`

Compare the sample solution for this question with the sample solution for [question 8d24](8d24.md).  You will
see that in the new solution, the functionality that is common to all fighters is in the `Fighter`
 class, while `LuckyFighter` overrides `takeDamage` and `calculateDamage` to
 add testing of luck according to the three strategies.  Look at the way `super` is used in these
 methods to invoke the default behaviour.  In particular, observe that the `calculateDamage` method
 in `LuckyFighter` uses:

```
super.calculateDamage() * AGGRESSIVE_MULTIPLIER
```

and

```
super.calculateDamage() - MISS_PENALTY
```

to compute values for double damage and damage reduced by one.  By invoking the superclass methods, instead of re-implementing their
behaviour, we ensure that any changes to `calculateDamage` in `Fighter` will be reflected in the increased or
reduced damage calculations in `LuckyFighter`.  To be specific: currently, `calculateDamage` in `Fighter`
returns 2.  However, if we decided to change this method to return, e.g., 4, or to return a value computed from the fighter's *skill* attribute,
`LuckyFighter`'s `calculateDamage` method would still have the desired effect of doubling, or reducing by one, this new value
when a fighter tests his/her luck.

`Main.java` shows that a `LuckyFighter` can be used exactly like a `Fighter` is used:

```
Fighter elfLord = new LuckyFighter("Alex", "Elf Lord", 18, 6, 11, Strategy.Defensive, gameEngine);
```

creates a new `LuckyFighter` and assigns a reference to this object to `elfLord`, which
has type `Fighter`.
