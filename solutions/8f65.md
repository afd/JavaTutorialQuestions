\begin{question}{Lucky battling fighters with inheritance.}
%
Compare the sample solution for this question with the sample solution for Question 9 of Sheet 1.  You will
see that in the new solution, the functionality that is common to all fighters is in the \lstinline{Fighter}
 class, while \lstinline{LuckyFighter} overrides \lstinline{takeDamage} and \lstinline{calculateDamage} to
 add testing of luck according to the three strategies.  Look at the way \lstinline{super} is used in these
 methods to invoke the default behaviour.  In particular, observe that the \lstinline{calculateDamage} method
 in \lstinline{LuckyFighter} uses:

 \begin{lstlisting}
super.calculateDamage() * AGGRESSIVE_MULTIPLIER
\end{lstlisting}
%
and
%
 \begin{lstlisting}
super.calculateDamage() - MISS_PENALTY
\end{lstlisting}
%
to compute values for double damage and damage reduced by one.  By invoking the superclass methods, instead of re-implementing their
behaviour, we ensure that any changes to \lstinline{calculateDamage} in \lstinline{Fighter} will be reflected in the increased or
reduced damage calculations in \lstinline{LuckyFighter}.  To be specific: currently, \lstinline{calculateDamage} in \lstinline{Fighter}
returns 2.  However, if we decided to change this method to return, e.g., 4, or to return a value computed from the fighter's \emph{skill} attribute,
\lstinline{LuckyFighter}'s \lstinline{calculateDamage} method would still have the desired effect of doubling, or reducing by one, this new value
when a fighter tests his/her luck.

\lstinline{Main.java} shows that a \lstinline{LuckyFighter} can be used exactly like a \lstinline{Fighter} is used:
%
\begin{lstlisting}
Fighter elfLord = new LuckyFighter("Alex", "Elf Lord", 18, 6, 11, Strategy.Defensive, gameEngine);
\end{lstlisting}
%
creates a new \lstinline{LuckyFighter} and assigns a reference to this object to \lstinline{elfLord}, which
has type \lstinline{Fighter}.
