## Solution to [a22c](../questions/a22c): *No duplicate email addresses*

See code at `solutions/code/tutorialquestions/questiona22c`

In package `checkforduplicates` I have defined an exception class:

\begin{lstlisting}
DuplicateEmailAddressException
\end{lstlisting}

This class extends `Exception`, meaning that it is a \emph{checked} exception.

I have equipped the `EmailAddress` class with a static field:

\begin{lstlisting}
private static Set<String> pastIdentifiers = new HashSet<String>();
\end{lstlisting}
%
storing identifiers that have previously been used in email addresses.  The constructor of `EmailAddress` first checks whether the given
identifier is in this set.  If it is, a `DuplicateEmailAddressException` is thrown.  As a result, the signature of the `EmailAddress`
constructor is:

\begin{lstlisting}
public EmailAddress(String identifier) throws DuplicateEmailAddressException;
\end{lstlisting}

 \noindent Because the constructors of `IndividualEmailAddress` and `GroupEmailAddress` both call the constructor of `EmailAddress`, these constructors are also declared as throwing `DuplicateEmailAddressException`.

`Demo` shows this exception being thrown in practice: the identifier `wayne@doc.ic.ac.uk` is used in the creation of two different
email addresses.

\vspace{1mm}\noindent\textbf{Advanced:} The package `checkforcycles` includes another exception class:

\begin{lstlisting}
CyclicEmailGroupException
\end{lstlisting}

This is an \emph{uncaught} exception (a.k.a.~a \emph{runtime} exception), because a good programmer should simply be careful not to create cyclic email group relationships.  It would be a pain
to have to enclose \emph{all} email address operations in `try...catch` blocks simply because of the possibility of cycles being introduced.

The `addEmailAddress` method of `GroupEmailAddress` uses helper method `reaches` to determine whether the email address
being added to the group itself contains a chain of email addresses that includes the group.  Inspect `reaches` and check that you understand it.
If `reaches` returns `true` then adding this email address would create a cycle, so instead a `CyclicEmailGroupException` is added. `Demo` provides an illustration of this exception being thrown in practice.
