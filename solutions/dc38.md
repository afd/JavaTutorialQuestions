\begin{question}{Email management system.}
The solution assuming that group relationships are acyclic is given in the \lstinline{acyclic} package.  I have used an abstract class, \lstinline{EmailAddress},
to hold an email address's identifier (common to individual and group addresses), and to implement \lstinline{toString()} and \lstinline{equals()}, which are purely
based on this identifier.  Because I have overridden \lstinline{equals()} I have dutifully overridden \lstinline{hashCode()} too.

I have declared \lstinline{getTargets()} abstract in \lstinline{EmailAddress}:

\begin{lstlisting}
public abstract Set<EmailAddress> getTargets();
\end{lstlisting}

Then I have made two subclasses, \lstinline{IndividualEmailAddress} and \lstinline{GroupEmail}\lstinline{Address}.  \lstinline{IndividualEmailAddress} simply overrides \lstinline{getTargets()} by returning a set
containing the individual email address. \lstinline{GroupEmailAddress} keeps a set of email addresses, \lstinline{members} to store members of the group.  The \lstinline{getTargets()} method is overridden
by recursively calling \lstinline{getTargets()} on each member, and constructing a set that is the union of all these results.  (Note that the group email address is not itself added to the result of \lstinline{getTargets()};
this method was required to include only individual email addresses.)

Think about the interplay between recursion and polymorphism in the implementation of \lstinline{getTargets()} in \lstinline{GroupEmailAddress}.

Package \lstinline{cyclic} shows how I have adapted the implementation of \lstinline{getTargets()} to handle cyclic relationships.  I have done this by implementing \lstinline{getTargets()} in
the \emph{abstract} class \lstinline{EmailAddress}, and making this implementation \lstinline{final} so that I do not accidentally override it elsewhere.  This \lstinline{getTargets()} method calls
a helper method:

\begin{lstlisting}
protected abstract Set<EmailAddress> getTargets(Set<EmailAddress> alreadySeen);
\end{lstlisting}
%
whose purpose is to find all targets recursively, but to stop recursing when an email address in the set \lstinline{alreadySeen} is encountered.  This method
is abstract because it needs to be implemented differently in \lstinline{IndividualEmailAddress} and \lstinline{GroupEmailAddress}.  It is protected so that
it cannot be accessed by classes outside the \lstinline{EmailAddress} inheritance hierarchy.\footnote{Unfortunately this is not true: because protected visibility is
more visible than package visibility this method can be seen by any classes in the \lstinline{cyclic} package.  But it is the best we can do in Java!}

The implementation of \lstinline{getTargets(alreadySeen)} in \lstinline{cyclic.IndividualEmail}\lstinline{Address} is identical to that for \lstinline{getTargets()} in
\lstinline{acyclic.IndividualEmailAddress}.

The implementation of \lstinline{getTargets(alreadySeen)} in \lstinline{cyclic.GroupEmailAddress} is similar to that for \lstinline{getTargets()} in \lstinline{acyclic.GroupEmailAddress}
except that it adds the following lines at the start:

\begin{lstlisting}
if(alreadySeen.contains(this)) {
  return result;
}
		
alreadySeen.add(this);
\end{lstlisting}

These lines ensure that we do not get into an infinite recursive loop when the relationship between email groups is cyclic.
