\begin{question}{Symmetric equality testing.}\label{question:symmetric}

The online tutorial:

www.artima.com/lejava/articles/equality.html

\noindent illustrates a very clever trick.  We equip \lstinline{Point}
with a method, \lstinline{canEqual}, which tells us the conditions an object must satisfy for it to even be \emph{considered}
as being \lstinline{equal} to a \lstinline{Point}.  In the case of a \lstinline{Point}, the condition is that the given object
should be an instance of \lstinline{Point}.  Thus we implement \lstinline{canEqual} as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}
public boolean canEqual(Object that) {
  return that instanceof Point;
}
\end{lstlisting}

Now in the \lstinline{equals} method of \lstinline{Point}, we test whether the incoming object is an instance of \lstinline{Point} as before
(except that to avoid duplication, we do this by calling \lstinline{canEqual}).  Then we cast the incoming object to a \lstinline{Point}, and
ask whether it \emph{can equal} the \lstinline{Point} on which \lstinline{equals} is being invoked.  If this test succeeds, we conclude by comparing
fields as before.

Checking \lstinline{canEqual} in both directions is what allows us to restore the \emph{symmetric} property that we require \lstinline{equals}
to satisfy.  In \lstinline{ColouredPoint} we \emph{override} \lstinline{canEqual}, strengthening the criterion to being an instance of
\lstinline{ColouredPoint}, not just of \lstinline{Point}:\footnote{Remember in the lecture I told you that it is \emph{usually} bad practice to override a method and make no reference to \lstinline{super}?  This is an exception (though note that if the overridden version of \lstinline{canEqual} returns \emph{true}, the superclass version would be guaranteed to do the same).}

\begin{lstlisting}
@Override
public boolean canEqual(Object that) {
  return that instanceof ColouredPoint;
}
\end{lstlisting}

The implementation of \lstinline{equals} in \lstinline{ColouredPoint} is now adapted analogously to how \lstinline{equals} was adapted for \lstinline{Point}: we check that the \lstinline{ColouredPoint} on which \lstinline{equals} is being invoked \lstinline{canEqual} the incoming object.  We then cast the incoming object to a \lstinline{ColouredPoint}, and test whether this \lstinline{ColouredPoint} \lstinline{canEqual} the \lstinline{ColouredPoint} on which \lstinline{equals} is being invoked.  Finally, we test superclass equality, and compare on the \lstinline{colour} fields, as before.

The crucial missing property that \lstinline{canEqual} has added is that if we compare a plain old \lstinline{Point} with a \lstinline{ColouredPoint} we are \emph{guaranteed} to get the result \lstinline{false}.  Thus the asymmetry identified in \questionref{equality} cannot occur.
