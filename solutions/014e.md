## Solution to [014e](../questions/014e.md): *Random numbers*

See code at `solutions/code/tutorialquestions/question014e`

The sample source code uses an array of booleans,
`found`, to determine whether each number in the given range has been found.
A `while` loop is used to continually generate random numbers in the range,
on each iteration setting `found[num]` to *true*, where `num`
is the generated number.

The program counts how many unique numbers have been generated, and the loop exits when this
number reaches the maximum permissible number.  An alternative would be to exit the loop
when `found` becomes uniformly *false*, though this would be considerably
less efficient.
