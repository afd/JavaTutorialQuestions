## Solution to [67dd](../questions/67dd.md): *Word count*

See code at `solutions/code/tutorialquestions/question67dd`

The sample source code solution should be fairly straightforward: check that you understand it.
The solution illustrates quite an ugly construct in Java: the expression

```
(line = br.readLine()) != null
```

which has the effect of calling `readLine()` on `br`, returning the result into `line`,
then comparing `line` with `null`.  This use of expressions that produce side-effects is
quite poor programming style in general: it can make code difficult to understand.  However, it is frequently
used when processing input, as follows (where `br` is a `BufferedReader`):

```
String line;
while((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
   ...
}
```

You can see that this is a bit more concise than the equivalent form that does not use a
side-effecting expression:

```
String line = br.readLine();
while(line != null) {
   ...
   line = br.readLine();
}
```

You will see the more concise form a lot in practice.
