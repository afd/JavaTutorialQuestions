## Solution to [b33f](../questions/b33f.md): *Logging using a functional interface*

See code at `solutions/code/tutorialquestions/questionb33f`

Compare the sample source code for this question with your solution.

Notice the use of the `ifPresent` method of `Optional` in my implementation of `FileInspector`.  This takes a *consumer* -- a void function whose argument is the element type of the optional, and can be used to perform an operation on the element of the optional if it exists.

Notice also the use of the `@FunctionalInterface` annotation on the `Logger` and `StringInspector` interfaces.  This annotation makes it illegal to add any more non-static, non-default methods to these interfaces, ensuring that it will always be possible to implement the interfaces concisely using lambdas.  Think about why adding static or default methods is OK.
