## Solution to [a6e7](../questions/a6e7): *Int set iterators*

See code at `solutions/code/tutorialquestions/questiona6e7`

The way iterators can be implemented for this question are exactly analogous to the methods demonstrated in
the solution to [question 1486](1486.md).  Again, I have provided three versions using standard classes, inner classes and anonymous inner
classes.

The interesting parts of this question are Steps 3 and 4.  Look at the `AbstractIntSet` class (in any of the solution versions)
to see that the iterator facilities provided by an `IntSet` allow us to implement algorithms to check containment, remove one set from another, add
one set to another, and turn a set into a string, at the abstract level.  We do not need to implement separate algorithms for `MemoryEfficientIntSet`
and `SpeedEfficientIntSet`.
