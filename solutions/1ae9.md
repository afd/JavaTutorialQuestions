## Solution to [1ae9](../questions/1ae9): *Reusing immutable value objects*

See code at `solutions/code/tutorialquestions/question1ae9`

\begin{question}{Reusing immutable value objects.}  I have implemented `makePoint` as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}
	public static Point makePoint(int coordX, int coordY, int coordZ) {
		Point p = new Point(coordX, coordY, coordZ);
		if(pool.get(p) != null) {
			return pool.get(p);
			// p will now be garbage collected
		}
		pool.put(p, p);
		return p;
	}
\end{lstlisting}

The first thing this method does is calls the constructor of `Point` to make a new point.  So the approach does not prevent
lots of identical points from being created.  However, it *does* avoid lots of identical points being stored forever.
The test: `if(pool.get(p) != null)` checks whether `pool` contains an entry of the form `(first, second)`
such that `p.equals(first)` holds.

If this is the case, the method returns `second`.  As a result, there are no
references to the point that was referred to by `p`, and eventually (though, as confirmed in \questionref{gc}, we do not know when)
the point will be garbage-collected.

Otherwise, the statement `pool.put(p, p)` causes the entry `(p, p)` to be inserted into the pool.  This means that
in future, if we call have a point `t` with `t.equals(p)`, the test `pool.get(t) != null` will hold.
As a result, we will never permanently create another point that is identical to `p`.

See class `objectpool.Demo` for a demonstration that this solution really works.
