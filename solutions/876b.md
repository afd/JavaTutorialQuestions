## Solution to [876b](../questions/876b): *Generics and subclasses*

See code at `solutions/code/tutorialquestions/question876b`

\begin{question}{Generics and subclasses.}\label{question:subtyping}
To see that `Set<B>` **cannot** safely be a subclass of `Set<A>`, consider the following method:

\begin{lstlisting}
public static void addToSet(Set<A> setOfA, A element) {
    setOfA.add(element);
}
\end{lstlisting}

If `Set<B>` was subclass of `Set<A>` then it should be fine to pass a reference of type
`Set<B>` as the first argument of `addToSet`.  This would mean that the following code would compile without errors:

\begin{lstlisting}
Set<B> mySetOfB = new HashSet<B>();
A myA = new A();
addToSet(mySetOfB, myA);
\end{lstlisting}

But this code would clearly go wrong at runtime: the effect would be an attempt to add `myA` to `mySetOfB`, when
`mySetOfB` is not capable of storing elements of type `myA`.

You can make the code fragment given in the question compile by changing:

\begin{lstlisting}
Set<A> setOfA = setOfB;
\end{lstlisting}

to either:

\begin{lstlisting}
Set<?> setOfA = setOfB;
\end{lstlisting}

(using a *wildcard* `?`), or:

\begin{lstlisting}
Set<? extends A> setOfA = setOfB;
\end{lstlisting}

(using a *bounded wildcard* `? extends A`).

In the question you were asked for the most specific possible choice, which is the use of the bounded wildcard.
