## Solution to [876b](../questions/876b): *Generics and subclasses*

See code at `solutions/code/tutorialquestions/question876b`

\begin{question}{Generics and subclasses.}\label{question:subtyping}
To see that \lstinline{Set<B>} \textbf{cannot} safely be a subclass of \lstinline{Set<A>}, consider the following method:

\begin{lstlisting}
public static void addToSet(Set<A> setOfA, A element) {
    setOfA.add(element);
}
\end{lstlisting}

If \lstinline{Set<B>} was subclass of \lstinline{Set<A>} then it should be fine to pass a reference of type
\lstinline{Set<B>} as the first argument of \lstinline{addToSet}.  This would mean that the following code would compile without errors:

\begin{lstlisting}
Set<B> mySetOfB = new HashSet<B>();
A myA = new A();
addToSet(mySetOfB, myA);
\end{lstlisting}

But this code would clearly go wrong at runtime: the effect would be an attempt to add \lstinline{myA} to \lstinline{mySetOfB}, when
\lstinline{mySetOfB} is not capable of storing elements of type \lstinline{myA}.

You can make the code fragment given in the question compile by changing:

\begin{lstlisting}
Set<A> setOfA = setOfB;
\end{lstlisting}
%
to either:
%
\begin{lstlisting}
Set<?> setOfA = setOfB;
\end{lstlisting}
%
(using a \emph{wildcard} \lstinline{?}), or:
%
\begin{lstlisting}
Set<? extends A> setOfA = setOfB;
\end{lstlisting}
%
(using a \emph{bounded wildcard} \lstinline{? extends A}).

In the question you were asked for the most specific possible choice, which is the use of the bounded wildcard.
