## Solution to [96df](../questions/96df): *Tree nodes*

See code at `solutions/code/tutorialquestions/question96df`

\begin{question}{Tree nodes.}\label{question:treenodes}
In my solution I define a \lstinline{TreeNode} interface specifying the methods that all tree nodes should support:
%
\lstinputlisting{src/sheet4/question3/solution/TreeNode.java}

I then define an abstract class, \lstinline{AbstractTreeNode}, that implements this interface and specifies
data and behaviour that should be the same for all tree nodes:

\begin{lstlisting}
public abstract class AbstractTreeNode<E> implements TreeNode<E> {

	private E key;
	
	@Override
	public final E getKey() {
		return key;
	}
	
	@Override
	public final void setKey(E key) {
		this.key = key;
	}
}
\end{lstlisting}

Notice that here I have made the \lstinline{getKey} and \lstinline{setKey} methods final: \lstinline{Abstract}\lstinline{TreeNode}
defines these methods once and for all.

I have not specified in this class how a node's children should be represented, nor have I provided implementations for
\lstinline{getNumberOfChildren}, \lstinline{getChild} or \lstinline{setChild}, which are required by the \lstinline{TreeNode}
interface.  These methods are implicitly declared \emph{abstract} in \lstinline{AbstractTreeNode}.

Class \lstinline{BinaryTreeNode} extends \lstinline{AbstractTreeNode} to define the behaviour of a tree node that has
two children.  The class declares two fields, one for each child:

\begin{lstlisting}
private TreeNode<E> firstChild;
private TreeNode<E> secondChild;
\end{lstlisting}

In addition, the \lstinline{BinaryTreeNode} class implements the \lstinline{getChild}, \lstinline{setChild} and \lstinline{getNumberOfChildren} methods.  The implementations
of these methods are straightforward.  For example, \lstinline{getNumberOfChildren} simply returns the integer 2.

\lstinline{LeafNode} is a similarly simple class to represent nodes that have no children.  Notice that the \lstinline{getChild}
and \lstinline{setChild} methods of this class use \lstinline{assert false} to cause execution to abort if they are called.

Alternatively (and preferably) these methods could throw a runtime exception, e.g., an \lstinline{UnsupportedOperationException}.
This would be preferable because a) assertion checking only happens if \lstinline{-ea} is specified as a JVM argument, and b)
after throwing an exception there is no need for the method to return a value.  This in \lstinline{getChild}, we can simply write:

\lstinline{throw new UnsupportedOperationException();}

\noindent instead of the less elegant:

\lstinline{assert false; return null;}.

Nodes that are not binary or leaf nodes are represented by the class \lstinline{Arbitrary}\lstinline{TreeNode}, which extends \lstinline{AbstractTreeNode}
and provides the node representation and operations as shown in the original \lstinline{TreeNode} class.	

\vspace{1mm}\noindent\textbf{Extension:}  See the sample solution for an implementation of \lstinline{toString()} in \lstinline{AbstractTreeNode}.
This illustrates the power of abstract classes: we can write an algorithm to turn an arbitrary tree node into a string, even though the (direct and indirect)
children of the tree node may have different runtime types.
