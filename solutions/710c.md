\begin{question}{The consequences of overriding \lstinline{equals}.}
%
Look at \lstinline{nohashcode/PointHash}\lstinline{CodeDemo.java} to see what can go wrong if you override \lstinline{equals}
but do not override \lstinline{hashCode}.

To see an acceptable implementation of \lstinline{hashCode} for \lstinline{Point}, look at \lstinline{hashcode/Point.java}.
In this implementation, I use each \lstinline{double} field of \lstinline{Point} to make a \lstinline{Double} object,
and call \lstinline{hashCode} on the resulting objects.  The \lstinline{Point}'s hash code is then constructed by combining
these hash codes using the bitwise exclusive-or operator (\lstinline{^}).  There are many other acceptable ways to implement
\lstinline{hashCode}, in terms of meeting the requirements of \lstinline{equals}.  You could simply return a constant (stupid,
but acceptable in this context), or you could add up the \lstinline{double} fields and return the result, cast to an \lstinline{int}.

You do \emph{not} need to override \lstinline{hashCode} in \lstinline{ColouredPoint} for the requirements of \lstinline{equals} to be
met: if two coloured points are equal then certainly they are equal when regarded as points, and thus \lstinline{Point} will give them
the same hash code.

However, in practice, it is beneficial to use the additional \emph{colour} field of a \lstinline{ColouredPoint} to make \lstinline{ColouredPoint}s'
hash codes more diverse.  You will see in \lstinline{hashcode/ColouredPoint.java} that I've overidden \lstinline{hashCode} to return the existing
\lstinline{Point} hash code, xor-ed with the hash code of the \lstinline{colour} field (which in my implementation is an enum).

\end{question}
