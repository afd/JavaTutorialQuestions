## Solution to [710c](../questions/710c.md): *The consequences of overriding `equals`*

See code at `solutions/code/tutorialquestions/question710c`

Look at `nohashcode/PointHash``CodeDemo.java` to see what can go wrong if you override `equals`
but do not override `hashCode`.

To see an acceptable implementation of `hashCode` for `Point`, look at `hashcode/Point.java`.
In this implementation, I use each `double` field of `Point` to make a `Double` object,
and call `hashCode` on the resulting objects.  The `Point`'s hash code is then constructed by combining
these hash codes using the bitwise exclusive-or operator (`^`).  There are many other acceptable ways to implement
`hashCode`, in terms of meeting the requirements of `equals`.  You could simply return a constant (stupid,
but acceptable in this context), or you could add up the `double` fields and return the result, cast to an `int`.

You do *not* need to override `hashCode` in `ColouredPoint` for the requirements of `equals` to be
met: if two coloured points are equal then certainly they are equal when regarded as points, and thus `Point` will give them
the same hash code.

However, in practice, it is beneficial to use the additional *colour* field of a `ColouredPoint` to make `ColouredPoint`s'
hash codes more diverse.  You will see in `hashcode/ColouredPoint.java` that I've overidden `hashCode` to return the existing
`Point` hash code, xor-ed with the hash code of the `colour` field (which in my implementation is an enum).
