## Solution to [1171](../questions/1171.md): *Cloning graphs*

See code at `solutions/code/tutorialquestions/question1171`

The question was broken down into steps and accompanied by various hints.  Look back at these
steps and hints, and see how the questions have been implemented in the sample source code solutions.  Here are just a few
further notes:

The implications of making a bitwise identical copy of an object are that an object reference field will
refer to the same object in both the original and copied object.  In the copy, object references will
*not* refer to fresh objects that have themselves been cloned.

`GraphNode<E>` inherits its `clone` method from `Object`.  The method is `protected`, thus it is only visible
to subclasses of `GraphNode<E>`, or to classes inside the `java.lang` package (the package of `Object`).  Because your `main` is in a class separate from `GraphNode<E>`, and not in the `java.lang` package, the call to `clone`
does not compile.  Note that when `clone` was called from method `foo` inside `GraphNode<E>` this was OK, because
the protected method `clone` in superclass `Object` is visible to methods in the subclass `GraphNode<E>`.
