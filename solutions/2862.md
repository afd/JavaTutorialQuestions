## Solution to [2862](../questions/2862): *Exceptions and inheritance (ii)*

See code at `solutions/code/tutorialquestions/question2862`

The reason that the classes compile even though `foo()` in `B` throws a different exception
from `foo()` in `A` is that the exception, `MyExceptionD`, thrown by `foo`
in `B` is a \emph{subclass} of `MyExceptionC` thrown by `foo` in `A`.
It is OK when overriding a method to \emph{narrow} the types of exceptions that can be thrown.  As discussed in
the solution to \questionref{inheritance}, this ensures that the overridden method behaves (in terms of the exceptions
it may throw) \emph{better} than the superclass method.

We call this change of exception types during overriding \emph{covariant}: \emph{co-} because the subclass method throws
 a subclass of the exception thrown by the superclass method.

If we remove `@Override` from `foo()` in `B`, add

\begin{lstlisting}
import java.io.IOException;
\end{lstlisting}

to the top of class `B` and change the declaration of `foo()` in `B` to:

\begin{lstlisting}
void foo() throws IOException {
  throw new IOException();
}
\end{lstlisting}

then class `B` does not compile.  The problem is that the compiler still thinks we are trying to override `foo`
in `A`, and tells us that the exception type `IOException` that we have specified does not match the exception
type specified for `foo` in `A`, which is `MyExceptionC`.

This tells us that in Java we cannot \emph{overload} methods based on the types of exceptions they throw.

Finally, the demo class given in the question does not compile because exception handling is checked by the compiler based on the
\emph{apparent} types of variables.  Variable `myB` has \emph{apparent} type `A`, even though it is initialised to
 have \emph{actual} type `B`.  Apparent type `A` means that the compiler thinks the call `myB.foo()` may
 throw an exception of type `MyExceptionC`, which is not sufficiently covered by the `catch` clause for exceptions
 of type `MyExceptionD`.

 This can be fixed by changing the apparent type of `myB` to `B`, or by down-casting `myB` to type `B` at the
 call site, or by catching an exception of type `MyExceptionC`.
