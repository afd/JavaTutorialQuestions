## Solution to [236b](../questions/236b.md): *Fields for properties*

See code at `solutions/code/tutorialquestions/question236b`

The key point here is that all of these fields are relevant
to all types of property, thus they should belong in the abstract `Property` superclass.
If you used a `Property` interface, rather than an abstract class, then you may need to adapt
your design a bit to allow these fields to be represented at an abstract level.

In the sample solution I have simply redefined `Property`, providing it with the new fields
with `protected` visibility (so that these fields are visible to subclasses of `Property`).
