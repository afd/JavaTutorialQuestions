## Solution to [236b](../questions/236b): *Fields for properties*

See code at `solutions/code/tutorialquestions/question236b`

TODO: add content

\begin{question}{Fields for properties.}  The key point here is that all of these fields are relevant
 to all types of property, thus they should belong in the abstract \lstinline{Property} superclass.
 If you used a \lstinline{Property} interface, rather than an abstract class, then you may need to adapt
 your design a bit to allow these fields to be represented at an abstract level.

 In the sample solution I have simply redefined \lstinline{Property}, providing it with the new fields
 with \lstinline{protected} visibility (so that these fields are visible to subclasses of \lstinline{Property}).

\end{question}
