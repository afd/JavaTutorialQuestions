## Solution to [7041](../questions/7041.md): *Cloning tree nodes*

See code at `solutions/code/tutorialquestions/question7041`

A tree node can be cloned using a
recursive method as follows:

```
public TreeNode<E> clone() {
  TreeNode<E> result = new TreeNode<E>(getNumberOfChildren());
  result.setKey(getKey());
  for(int i = 0; i < getNumberOfChildren(); i++) {
    result.setChild(i, getChild(i).clone());
  }
  return result;
}
```

Notice that `TreeNode<E> result = new TreeNode<E>(getNumberOfChildren());` causes a brand new `TreeNode`
object to be allocated (creating a genuine copy), while `result.setKey(getKey());` sets the `key` of `result`
to refer to the same object as the `key` of the object on which `clone()` is invoked.  Thus the key itself is not cloned.
