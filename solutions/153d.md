## Solution to [153d](../questions/153d.md): *Exceptions and inheritance (iii)*

See code at `solutions/code/tutorialquestions/question153d`

* **command-line argument "0".** `parseInt` gives us the integer 0, so we hit case 0 of the `switch` statement, and throw
an exception of type `A`.  This is not matched by the `catch` block for exceptions of type `C`, or the `catch` block
for exceptions of type `B`, but it *is* matched by the `catch` block for exceptions of type `A`.  In this `catch` block, the exception `e` is printed, so `exception A` is printed to the console (this comes from the `toString` method in class `A`).  The exception is then thrown again.  It does not match the `catch` block for exceptions of type `NumberFormatException`, but it *does* match the `catch` block for exceptions of type `Exception`, thus we see the text:
`An exception was thrown: exception A`.  After this, the `finally` block is executed, so we finally see the text: `All control-flow paths get to me!`.

* **command-line argument "1".** `parseInt` gives us the integer 1, so we hit case 1 of the `switch` statement, and throw
an exception of type `B`.  This is not matched by the `catch` block for exceptions of type `C`, but it *is* matched
by the `catch` block for exceptions of type `B`.  In this `catch` block, the exception `e` is printed, so `exception B is an exception A` is printed to the console (this comes from the `toString` method in class `B`).  The exception is then thrown again, and
is matched by the `catch` block for exceptions of type `A` (because `B` is a subclass of `A`).  In this `catch` block, the exception `e` is printed, so `exception B is an exception A` is printed to the console again.  The exception is then thrown once again.  It does not match the `catch` block for exceptions of type `NumberFormatException`, but it *does* match the `catch` block for exceptions of type `Exception`, thus we see the text:
`An exception was thrown: exception B is an exception A`.  After this, the `finally` block is executed, so we finally see the text: `All control-flow paths get to me!`.

* **command-line argument "2".** `parseInt` gives us the integer 2, so we hit case 2 of the `switch` statement, and throw
an exception of type `C`.  Following an argument analogous to the above, we then see the following output:

```
exception C is an exception B is an exception A
exception C is an exception B is an exception A
exception C is an exception B is an exception A
An exception was thrown: exception C is an exception B is an exception A
All control-flow paths get to me!
```

* **command-line argument "3".** This time `parseInt` gives us the integer 3, which does not match any of the cases in the switch.  Thus we do not enter any `catch` block, and the text `No exception was thrown.` is output.  The `finally` block is still executed, leading to the output `All control-flow paths get to me!`.

* **command-line argument "1.2".**  With this argument, `parseInt` throws a `NumberFormatException`, which is caught by the `catch` block for exceptions of type `NumberFormatException`.  Thus the message `The command-line argument you entered was not an integer!` is output.  This is followed by execution of the `finally` block as usual.

* **no command-line arguments.**  With no command-line arguments, an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` is thrown when the argument `args[0]` to `parseInt` is evaluated.  This exception is caught by the `catch` block for exceptions of type `Exception`, and we see the text: `An exception was thrown: java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 0`.  After this, the
    `finally` block is executed as usual.
