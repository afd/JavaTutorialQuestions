\begin{question}{Exceptions and inheritance (iii).}

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{command-line argument "0".} \lstinline{parseInt} gives us the integer 0, so we hit case 0 of the \lstinline{switch} statement, and throw
an exception of type \lstinline{A}.  This is not matched by the \lstinline{catch} block for exceptions of type \lstinline{C}, or the \lstinline{catch} block
for exceptions of type \lstinline{B}, but it \emph{is} matched by the \lstinline{catch} block for exceptions of type \lstinline{A}.  In this \lstinline{catch} block, the exception \lstinline{e} is printed, so ``{\tt exception A}'' is printed to the console (this comes from the \lstinline{toString} method in class \lstinline{A}).  The exception is then thrown again.  It does not match the \lstinline{catch} block for exceptions of type \lstinline{NumberFormatException}, but it \emph{does} match the \lstinline{catch} block for exceptions of type \lstinline{Exception}, thus we see the text:
``{\tt An exception was thrown: exception A}''.  After this, the \lstinline{finally} block is executed, so we finally see the text: ``All control-flow paths get to me!''.

\item \textbf{command-line argument "1".} \lstinline{parseInt} gives us the integer 1, so we hit case 1 of the \lstinline{switch} statement, and throw
an exception of type \lstinline{B}.  This is not matched by the \lstinline{catch} block for exceptions of type \lstinline{C}, but it \emph{is} matched
by the \lstinline{catch} block for exceptions of type \lstinline{B}.  In this \lstinline{catch} block, the exception \lstinline{e} is printed, so ``{\tt exception B is an exception A}'' is printed to the console (this comes from the \lstinline{toString} method in class \lstinline{B}).  The exception is then thrown again, and
is matched by the \lstinline{catch} block for exceptions of type \lstinline{A} (because \lstinline{B} is a subclass of \lstinline{A}).  In this \lstinline{catch} block, the exception \lstinline{e} is printed, so ``{\tt exception B is an exception A}'' is printed to the console again.  The exception is then thrown once again.  It does not match the \lstinline{catch} block for exceptions of type \lstinline{NumberFormatException}, but it \emph{does} match the \lstinline{catch} block for exceptions of type \lstinline{Exception}, thus we see the text:
``{\tt An exception was thrown: exception B is an exception A}''.  After this, the \lstinline{finally} block is executed, so we finally see the text: ``All control-flow paths get to me!''.

\item \textbf{command-line argument "2".} \lstinline{parseInt} gives us the integer 2, so we hit case 2 of the \lstinline{switch} statement, and throw
an exception of type \lstinline{C}.  Following an argument analogous to the above, we then see the following output:

\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{verbatim}
exception C is an exception B is an exception A
exception C is an exception B is an exception A
exception C is an exception B is an exception A
An exception was thrown: exception C is an exception B is an exception A
All control-flow paths get to me!
\end{verbatim}
\end{scriptsize}

\item \textbf{command-line argument "3".} This time \lstinline{parseInt} gives us the integer 3, which does not match any of the cases in the switch.  Thus we do not enter any \lstinline{catch} block, and the text ``{\tt No exception was thrown.}'' is output.  The \lstinline{finally} block is still executed, leading to the output ``{\tt All control-flow paths get to me!}''.

\item \textbf{command-line argument "1.2".}  With this argument, \lstinline{parseInt} throws a \lstinline{NumberFormatException}, which is caught by the \lstinline{catch} block for exceptions of type \lstinline{NumberFormatException}.  Thus the message ``{\tt The command-} {\tt line argument you entered was not an integer!}'' is output.  This is followed by execution of the \lstinline{finally} block as usual.

\item \textbf{no command-line arguments.}  With no command-line arguments, an \lstinline{ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException} is thrown when the argument \lstinline{args[0]} to \lstinline{parseInt} is evaluated.  This exception is caught by the \lstinline{catch} block for exceptions of type \lstinline{Exception}, and we see the text: ``{\tt An exception was thrown: java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 0}''.  After this, the
    \lstinline{finally} block is executed as usual.

\end{itemize}
