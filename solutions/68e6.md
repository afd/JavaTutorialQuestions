## Solution to [68e6](../questions/68e6.md): *Using Stream.reduce*

See code at `solutions/code/tutorialquestions/question68e6`

Compare your solution to the sample code.

Note the use in the sample code of `Integer.MAX_VALUE` and `Integer.MIN_VALUE` to get the largest and smallest representable integer values, respectively.

That `findMinOfMaxes` works by mapping `findMax` over a streamed version of `listOfLists`.  It is necessary to collect the result of this map operation back to a list in order to invoke `findMin` on the result.
