## Solution to [6346](../questions/6346.md): *Depth of arithmetic expressions*

See code at `solutions/code/tutorialquestions/question6346`

Take a look at the sample solution code.  The solution is pretty straightforward.  Note that the `Math.max` static method is used to compute the depth of a binary expression, by comparing the depths of the left and right sub-expressions.
