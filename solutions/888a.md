## Solution to [888a](../questions/888a.md): *Generic methods with streams*

See code at `solutions/code/tutorialquestions/question888a`

Compare your solution with the code in the sample solution.

The main thing to understand about the code for these questions is that generic type information for a method (e.g. of the form `<S, T>`) comes *before* the return type of the method, and *after* any other keywords such as `static` or `public`.

The sample implementation of `zip`, which uses `IntStream` and `mapToObj`, is worth studying carefully.
