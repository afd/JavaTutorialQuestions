## Solution to [30cd](../questions/30cd): *Heap exhaustion*

See code at `solutions/code/tutorialquestions/question30cd`

Examine class `HeapExhaustion` and compare it with your solution.

Running class `HeapExhaustion` from the sample solution three times in succession, I get the following output:

```
Length of list before memory exhausted: 11451103
Length of list before memory exhausted: 11451103
Length of list before memory exhausted: 11451103
```

The fact that the same number of objects added to the list before memory is exhausted in all three runs *suggests* (though of course provides no guarantee) that the Java Virtual Machine's memory allocator is behaving deterministically, allocating objects in the same manner on each run of the program.
