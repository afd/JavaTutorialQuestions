## Solution to [b401](../questions/b401): *Generic sets*

See code at `solutions/code/tutorialquestions/questionb401`

\begin{question}{Generic sets.}\label{question:genericsets}  Making the solution to the \textbf{int set} question
of Sheet 3 (Question 9) generic is also straightforward: compare the sample solutions.

To make the method:

\begin{lstlisting}
public static IntSet readIntegers(int n) throws IOException;
\end{lstlisting}

return instead a `GenericSet` with element type `Integer` you need to change the method's signature as
follows:

\begin{lstlisting}
public static GenericSet<Integer> readIntegers(int n) throws IOException;
\end{lstlisting}

In the implementation of the method, where you would use:

\vspace{1mm}
`IntSet`, `MemoryEfficientIntSet` or `SpeedEfficientIntSet`
\vspace{1mm}

\noindent instead use:

\vspace{1mm}
`GenericSet<Integer>`, `MemoryEfficientGenericSet<Integer>`
or

`SpeedEfficientGenericSet<Integer>`

\vspace{1mm}
\noindent respectively.

When your program prints the type of set that has been returned by the `readIntegers` method you should find that
it either says:

```SpeedEfficientIntSet`''

\noindent or

```MemoryEfficientIntSet`''.

\noindent The generic parameter
`<Integer>` is \emph{not} shown.  This is because generic information is not present at runtime.  Remember that
the compiler performs \emph{type erasure}, which gets rid of this information during the compilation process.
