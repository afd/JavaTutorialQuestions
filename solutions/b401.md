## Solution to [b401](../questions/b401): *Generic sets*

See code at `solutions/code/tutorialquestions/questionb401`

Making [the solution to the question 8a61](8a61.md) generic is fairly straightforward: compare the sample solutions.

To make the method:

```
public static IntSet readIntegers(int n) throws IOException;
```

return instead a `GenericSet` with element type `Integer` you need to change the method's signature as
follows:

```
public static GenericSet<Integer> readIntegers(int n) throws IOException;
```

In the implementation of the method, where you would use:

`IntSet`, `MemoryEfficientIntSet` or `SpeedEfficientIntSet`

instead use:

`GenericSet<Integer>`, `MemoryEfficientGenericSet<Integer>`
or

`SpeedEfficientGenericSet<Integer>`

respectively.

When your program prints the type of set that has been returned by the `readIntegers` method you should find that
it either says:

`SpeedEfficientIntSet`

or

`MemoryEfficientIntSet`.

The generic parameter
`<Integer>` is *not* shown.  This is because generic information is not present at runtime.  Remember that
the compiler performs *type erasure*, which gets rid of this information during the compilation process.
