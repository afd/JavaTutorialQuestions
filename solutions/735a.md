## Solution to [735a](../questions/735a): *Generic iterators*

See code at `solutions/code/tutorialquestions/question735a`

Making the iterator classes of [question 1486](1486.md) and [question 8a61](8a61.md) generic is fairly straightforward:
it basically just involves stripping out specific types and replacing them with generic ones.  Compare the sample solutions to see this.

**Extension:** The sample solution provides a unifying interface, `GenericCollection`, that offers the `iterator()`
method, and the `GenericStack` and `GenericSet` interfaces both extend `GenericCollection`.
