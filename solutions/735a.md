## Solution to [735a](../questions/735a): *Generic iterators*

See code at `solutions/code/tutorialquestions/question735a`

\begin{question}{Generic iterators.} Making the iterator classes of Questions 10 and Question 11 of Sheet 3 generic is fairly straightforward:
it basically just involves stripping out specific types and replacing them with generic ones.  Compare the sample solutions to see this.

\vspace{1mm}\noindent
\textbf{Extension:} The sample solution provides a unifying interface, `GenericCollection`, that offers the `iterator()`
method, and the `GenericStack` and `GenericSet` interfaces both extend `GenericCollection`.

\end{question}
