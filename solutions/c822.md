## Solution to [c822](../questions/c822): *Problems cloning tree nodes*

See code at `solutions/code/tutorialquestions/questionc822`


\begin{question}{Problems cloning tree nodes.}\label{question:problemscloningtreenodes}
Invoking `n1.clone()`, where `n1` is an object referenced by the following code
fragment and `TreeNode` is the class produced in \questionref{cloningtreenodes}:

\begin{lstlisting}
TreeNode<String> n1 = new TreeNode<String>(1);
n1.setKey("A");
TreeNode<String> n2 = new TreeNode<String>(1);
n2.setKey("B");
n1.setChild(0, n2);
n2.setChild(0, n1);
\end{lstlisting}
%
leads to an infinite loop.  The problem is that `n1` is not really a tree node, because `n1` has `n2` as a child, and
`n2` has `n1` as a child.  Thus the nodes form a cyclic graph, as shown in \figref{cyclic}.  The recursive `clone` method descends forever through this cycle,
building a longer and longer corresponding tree, as indicated by \figref{infinitetree} of duplicates of `n1` and `n2`.
Practically, this leads to the program terminating with a `java.lang.StackOverflowError`.

\begin{figure}

\vspace{5mm}
\caption{Tree nodes `n1` and `n2`.}\label{fig:cyclic}%
\end{minipage}%
\qquad
\begin{minipage}{0.7\textwidth}%
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{Sheet4Question5InfiniteTree}
\end{center}
\caption{Start of infinite unfolding of this cyclic graph into a tree.}\label{fig:infinitetree}%
\end{minipage}%
\end{figure}

If we invoke `n3.clone()`, where `n3` is an object referenced by the following code
fragment:	
		
\begin{lstlisting}
TreeNode<String> n3 = new TreeNode<String>(2);
n3.setKey("C");
TreeNode<String> n4 = new TreeNode<String>(1);
n4.setKey("D");
TreeNode<String> n5 = new TreeNode<String>(0);
n5.setKey("E");
n3.setChild(0, n4);
n3.setChild(1, n5);
n4.setChild(0, n5);
\end{lstlisting}
%
then `clone` terminates, but the structure produced does not match the original.  This is because
`n3`, `n4` and `n5` do not really form a tree, they actually form a directed
acyclic graph (DAG) that is not a tree.  This is because, as shown in \figref{dag}, node `n5` has both
`n3` and `n4` as a parent.

\begin{figure}
\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}%
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{Sheet4Question5Dag}
\end{center}
\caption{DAG represented by tree nodes `n3`, `n4` and `n5`.}\label{fig:dag}%
\end{minipage}%
\qquad
\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}%
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{Sheet4Question5TreeFromDag}
\end{center}
\caption{Tree resulting from cloning the DAG of \figref{dag}.}\label{fig:dagunfolding}%
\end{minipage}%
\end{figure}


The `clone` method will produce a tree from this DAG in which the `n5` node has been duplicated,
as shown in \figref{dagunfolding}.

\vspace{1mm}\noindent\textbf{Preconditions for `setChild()`:}  When `child` is passed as argument
to `setChild`, it must be the case that `child` does not already have a parent.  This avoids the
construction of a DAG that is not a tree.  Also, when `child` is passed as an argument to `setChild`,
it must be the case that the tree node on which `setChild` is being invoked is not a (direct or indirect)
descendent of `child`.  This ensures that cyclic structures are not created.

\vspace{1mm}\noindent\textbf{Advanced:} Look at `TreeNode` in the `precondition` package.  This class implements these precondition checks.
The single-parent check is made by equipping each `TreeNode` with a `numberOfParents` field.  The
implementation of `setChild` is then responsible for checking and maintaining this field.  Unfortunately this
does lead to added complexity in `setChild`.  The check that the child node does not reach its parent is
implemented through a recursive method `reaches`, which performs a depth-first search for the parent, starting from the child.
