## Solution to [8a61](../questions/8a61): *Int set*

See code at `solutions/code/tutorialquestions/question8a61`

You will see that I decided to implement `MemoryEfficientIntSet` using
an `ArrayList`, and `SpeedEfficientIntSet` using a `HashSet`.

In the implementation of `readIntegers(int n)` in *Demo.java*, the key observation is that we can write:

```
IntSet result = (n > 10 ? new MemoryEfficientIntSet() : new SpeedEfficientIntSet());
```

to create *either* a `MemoryEfficientIntSet` or a `SpeedEfficientIntSet` depending on
`n`.  Whichever kind of set is created, the resulting reference is stored in `result` which
has type `IntSet`.  This means that thereafter we can manipulate the set through the `IntSet`
interface regardless of its actual type.
