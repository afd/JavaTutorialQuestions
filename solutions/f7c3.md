## Solution to [f7c3](../questions/f7c3.md): *Pig Latin*

See code at `solutions/code/tutorialquestions/questionf7c3`

The sample code solution declares a method `translateToPigLatin` that
translates a string, assumed to be alpha-numeric, into Pig Latin.  Static method `isDigit` of
the `Character` class, and
the `charAt` instance method of `String` are used to check whether the first character of
the input string is a digit; if this is the case the string is returned unchanged.  Otherwise, the
Pig Latin transformation is performed relatively straightforwardly using a helper method, `isVowel`.
The solution illustrates the use of the `substring` method on strings, and Java's *ternary*
operator:

```
b ? e1 : e2
```

which evaluates to `e1` if Boolean expression `b` holds,
and to `e2` otherwise.

Method `translateLineToPigLatin` is responsible for splitting up a line into individual words,
which are processed by `translateToPigLatin`.  The `main` method uses a `BufferedReader`
to process lines from standard input.
